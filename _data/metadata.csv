In the beginning, there was the ""Collective Subconscious"", a video concept in an eight-part series of video shorts (2-5 minutes each) presenting narratives abstracts about life, death, growth, environment, love, sex, religion, and personal values and/or principles. Each with its own set of storyline, characters and filmic distinction that is totally unrelated and disconnected from each other; but generally, unified by one theme that of indifference. or

In its stead came the concept of ""Dreamwalker""; a three-part video production patterned after the ""Collective Subconscious"". Consisting of three video shorts unrelated and disconnected from each other; but generally embraced by the theme of indifference that unifies them. The first two are poems and the third is a narrative non-genre. They are titled: Dreams and Although ""Dreamwalker"" has reached its first rough cut stage, it still has to be dropped, or its first two parts discontinued, and leave the third part to stand alone. To become the final version of the concept that started with eight, and now, that is left to only one. In the beginning, there were eight, and in the end, there was only One.

With the aim of contributing in the dissemination of knowledge concerning the damage being done to our surroundings, Ms. Cabusao and Ms. Macasaet chose to make an environmental thesis production. production Wanting to produce an environmental different from the usual pollution and illegal loggings, the two thought of doing one on coral reefs. And after deliberating over the best possible way of realizing said project, Ms. Cabusao and Ms. Macasaet finally decided that they could better visualize the coral reefs by using the technique of animation.
The two were joined by two other students, Ms. Sherida Castilla and Ms. Elaine Lazarito, who were having difficulties with their own topic proposal. So much so that Ms. Cabusao and Ms. Macasaet offered the two to join the group in making the animation. Thank God Ms. Castilla and Ms. Lazarito agreed to make the group a foursome.
Nightmares (Are Made Of...), Anyone Lived in A Pretty How Tawn (by E.E.Cummings), and One, respectively.
But Dreamwalker has to be dropped.
Both concepts (Collective Subconscious and Dreamwalker) aim to produce visually, or in video, certain feelings emotions, moods, characteristics, attitudes, more with the unconventional use and and manipulation of the camera, the lights, and the editing equipments; and less with the characters and the script itself.
Moreso, both concepts aim to make use of collected, unrelated footages, distorted shots, and flat frames; and then montaging them to create a simple (even basic), yet unconventional approach to the expression of everyday and often taken-for-granted sentiments of people. a
Both are a great challenge for a filmmaker, and both are exciting filmically as student much as literarily. But both are difficult (even complex) for a student with very limited resources. The magnanimity of the work to be done (in all the aspects of production), the financing to be made, the casting to be arranged; coupled with the wideness of scope of the shooting and all the camera work that has to be achieved could all have been a drain of time, money, and effort for a lone student filmmaker. Reason enough to cut concepts to their utmost limits.

""Dreams Deferred"" is a video documentary about gifted children in the Philippines. Traditionally, the ""special"" children who have been given attention in this country have been the ones on the other extreme of the spectrum: the handicapped, or mentally/physically challenged. Special children who are exceptionally intelligent or talented-- gifted-- have been assumed to be able to take care of themselves. After all, they are gifted. In a country short on resources, they have no choice but to fend for themselves.
This mistaken notion has resulted in a great loss of opportunity for the Philippines. One can only imagine what they might have been able to achieve for the development of the nation had their gifts been properly nurtured. This documentary is an attempt to focus attention on this often ignored and little explored subject.
Recently, the media particularly broadcast and print media have trained the spotlight on the gifted. In the past months and years articles have been written and segments have been done in mainstream newspapers and television shows. Gifted children even became the theme of a national advertising campaign for a product (Promil) by a major company (Wyeth-Suaco). All these efforts have done much to place the education of the gifted in the national consciousness.
This thesis is an attempt to contribute to that effort. Its title takes its inspiration from a poem by Langston Hughes, written from the point of view of a black child in America wondering if his dreams will ever be fulfilled given the enormous obstacles he faces as a marginalized member of his society. Through the use of well-organized and creative visuals, the documentary explores the challenge posed to gifted children in a country which can offer so little in terms of resources, infrastructure, and other kinds of support. This filmmaker's hope is that it will educate its viewers about the issues and questions involved in the subject of gifted children. Though seemingly not as urgent as other national issues, the author believes that it is a significant one which deserves priority. Its target audience is everyone-- students of all fields, parents, professionals, educators who, collectively and in their own ways, could have an impact on the way gifted chidren are viewed and treated in the Philippines.

ISANG SILIP is a video narrative that combines soft-core science fiction with contemporary crime drams. It is a hypothetical fast forward to a time when all the ""What ifs"" could come true. The narrative paints a cold and harsh look into the future of Philippine society where someday, violence may be condoned and accepted as a means to claim justice.
Despite the stark and cynical backdrop, ISANG SILIP presents a touch of humanity in its story line, a spark of hope in the form of one's quest for freedom and redemption. The filmmakers have set out to prioritize this element by stressing the dramatic flow, in order to create a certain ""human side"" to the narrative and at the same time make the film uniquely different from other science fiction movies. As a result, the narrative has an amalgam of different genres. The danger in a virtually lawless society, the lonely search for a new beginning and the future's satirical bite make ISANG SILIP truly exceptional in itself.
Throughout time, humanity has valued freedom highly. The film reflects this quality in the persona of the lead character, whose motive is to seek liberation. The narrative as a whole conveys human angst, a feeling of loneliness and desolation, revenge and redemption, hate and desire.
The film will embody what media has inadvertently portrayed--a world of consuming violence. People have been left with little or no control over what is being fed to them. This narrative is an answer to those who present brutality onscreen. ISANG SILIP gives a dose of the reality that people are being influenced by this violence, somehow.

What this research aims to uncover is nothing especially new in the sense that this has been topics of discussions ever since. It aims to point out how we have been greatly influenced by the Spaniards further, even after colonizing us, imprinting upon us their culture. This great transformation, despite its presence today, is mixed with other strong influences. The question now is this: what is truly Filipino? We have been led to believe that the conservative attitude is what is truly Filipino while the liberal attitude is what is modern and foreign. But actually, as proven by the book Pagsusulatan nang Dalauang Binibini na si Urbana at ni Feliza na Nagtuturo ng Mabuting Kaugalian by Padre Modesto de Castro in 1864, we have been influenced into a culture, arguably was dictatted by the book. Thus the Filipino concept of 'perfect housewives, ""lady-like', and 'walang-modo', and so on, have been based on a constructed culture written by a Spanish priest. So the question again stands: What is truly Filipino?
After having read Ambeth Ocampo's books, Rizal Without the Overcoat and Looking Back, the researcher/filmmaker has realized that there are so much more interesting facts about our culture and our history than what was learned in school and at home. This interest was furthered by the book Pagsusulatan nang Dalauang Binibini na si Urbana at ni Feliza na Nagtuturo ng Mabuting Kaugalian written by Padre Modesto de Castro in 1864. This book was found to be particularly interesting not only because it was trying to dictate social norms (which today, in comparison, would be far-fetched), but also because it was in this period that the social norms today began.
This thesis intends to re-present and reflect upon the kind of culture that we have today; tracing its roots to the 19th century, the age of Maria Clara and religious fanaticism. This historical flashback aims to help the audience to understand the origins of this culture.

The thesis of the documentary is that a lesbian can assimilate herself in society given the love and support her nuclear family.
In Philippine society, the individual does not exist independently from his family. The family live in such a way that its members learn to care and take responsibility of each other. And as the case may be, the individual values acceptance within the family more than he values acceptance within society.
The researchers of this study believe that when a family member is ostracized by society for being homosexual, the family, especially the younger siblings, bears the brunt of social castigation. This pernicious attitude towards the homosexual compels the family to defend the individual. Should the family defend the individual, they also go through the painful process that the homosexual undergoes.

When ""Paalam"" was still being written, the writers' main purpose was to pay a final tribute to their loved ones who had just passed away. It will be their last gift. their final good-bye and thank you to the special and treasured memories of beloved parents and a cherished grandfather. However, when the script entered its final draft, the writers' discovered other dimensions to the film's objectives.
The narrative is dedicated to the writers' relatives who have moved on but it is also for those who are left behind. ""Paalam"" aims to help enlighten the minds of the people who underwent similar experiences, that grief. no matter how painful, can never be quantified. Also, the film's other goal is to help guide the friends of the mourners as to how they should relate with them. Death is painful, it is tragic and traumatic but after watching ""Paalam"" it is the writers hope that viewers will see death not as an absolute despair but rather hopeful.

In a 1986 study by Theresa C. Carino entitled, Chinese Women in Manila: Changing Roles and Perceptions, she compared two generations of Philippine Chinese women, 20 college girls and their mothers. She was surprised to find that while the daughters had higher career aspirations than their mothers, both generations still believed home management to be an exclusively female domain. Also, while these women described men in general as ""intelligent, had leadership attributes, were agressive, logical, self-confident, ambitious, competitive and competent,"" they described themselves with adjectives commonly associated with the subordinate sex: 1 ""intelligent, sensitive, faithful, honest, emotional, religious, submissive, and gentle."" Obviously, a difference in ages or generation does not necessarily mean a difference in views. Is it the culture then, that makes these women think this way? And of course, there are those little, big signs that everyone sees everywhere. That ad in the paper, making one believe: Woman! Skinnier is better. That cutesy actress in that cutesy film with her wondah-ful clothes and mah-velous hats. What woman can resist the urge to splurge after that? And that song. Are girls just Barbie girls, to be undressed anywhere? There must be a conspiracy in media to make women feel bad about themselves. Is it any wonder that it is so hard for a woman to gain self-worth?
HerStory traces the history of Joan, a 23-year old woman of Chinese descent. It is Joan's story of how she lost and found herself. But man is never the enemy.

Life and love between two brothers living the pressures of growing up in the 90's. The two brothers are very close when growing up but their differences and age gap causes their separation. The love tries to be maintained but their love for one another fades away with time due to the problems of life (parental & peer pressure & substance abuse). The story also tackles the theme of irony and how these pressures can affect this brotherly love that can result into tragedy.

""Manyika is a three-minute experimental film about a woman's worth in a conservative society's eyes. It is a commentary on how a woman is expected to be nothing more than a doll, willing to be manipulated by the demands to conform to the standards of the social structure she is born and confined into.
Our film is a study of contrasts between the only two options a Filipina is damned into. She can either be the angel- the innocent, pure epitome of the mores; or the slut- a dirty woman, unworthy of anyone's respect. This, in a world where there are few, if rare, exceptions. Society is quick to judge, preferring the vulnerable, innocent angel that it can freely manipulate to the unwed, non-virgins. In our opinion, both personas are less than ideal and are both limiting to a woman's potential. A woman's worth therefore, is so mistakenly judged by the existence of that fragile sheath of skin between her legs and not by her strengths, talents or capabilities. Her chastity or lack thereof has nothing to do with who she is, but sadly it has everything to do with what society sees her to be. It doesn't have to be one or the other. There are gradations of color between white and red, and it is time people started to see and appreciate the variety of color that lies between them.",PROSTITUTES IN FILM,fil,Expe. ,4:02,"Padilla, Karen Marie P.; Tenorio, Maria Lourdes S.","Padilla, Ramoncito; Padilla, Mary Ann; Tenorio, Antonio; Tenorio, Lirio; Lee, Ruben; Padilla, Karen; Cruz, Glenn; Factora, Mylene; Macas, Audrey;","De Guzman, Anne Marie G.

During the span of one week, she experiences the difficulty that comes with being overweight and the pressure that society puts on being thin and beautiful. In the end, she realizes that the only ways to feel good and have fun is to accept herself as she is. The reason why I chose this topic for my thesis is because the issue of being overweight in a thin society has been confronting me all my life. I have tried everything to lose weight but nothing worked. The so-called problem is in my genes but society doesn't want to accept that. They would rather think of fat people as being lazy slobs who eat all day. I am sick of trying to measure up to society's standards of beauty.

Ang aking tesis na isang maikling naratibong pinamagatang ""Paglisan"" ay tungkol sa mga ala-ala ng isang ina sa kanyang kaisa-isang anak na babae na humiwalay na sa kanya. Isang pagsilip sa buhay ni Nicole (ang ina) sa pamamagitan ng pagbukas ng isang pahina sa kanyang buhay talaan - ang kanyang pinakatatagong diary. Sa pagdaloy ng pelikula ay malalaman nating noong ipinagbubuntis pa lamang ni Nicole ang kanyang anak ay gusto na itong ipalaglag o patayin ni Miguel, ang kanyang asawa. Ngunit hindi siya napilit nito at itinuloy pa rin niya ang pagbubuntis hanggang sa maipanganak nga niya si Denerisa.
Mula pagkabata ni Denerisa ay hindi na siya pinakitaan ng pagmamahal ng ama niya. Nariyang sinasaktan siya ng pisikal maliban sa emosyonal na pagpapasakit nito sa anak sa pagtanda. At bilang isang ina ay ang tanging maipapalit niya sa mga sakit na ito ay ang kanyang pagaaruga, paguunawa at pasensya.
Hanggang sa makapagtapos na ang kanyang anak. Sa araw ng pagkamit ng diploma ng anak, naaalala niya ang mga pangyayaring nagsilbing sanhi ng mga sakit at galit na rin mula sa anak para sa ama. At sa pagalis ng kanyang anak ay hinahangad niya ang isang buhay na punong-puno ng ganap na pagmamahal, isang buhay na kailanman ay hindi natagpuan ng anak sa sariling pamilya.
Ang katapusan ng pelikula ay hindi masaya at hindi rin malungkot. Ito ay puro tinatapos sa mga salitang hangad ay pagasa para sa anak at para na rin sa ama.","MEMORY IN FILMS

The documentary follows the search of two film students as they look for their old toys and old memories. In the process they interview fellow children of the 1980's and discover that they are not alone in their search, it seems that others are remembering and feel the need to bring their old toys back as well. This leads them to interview certain people who could help explain their fascination with bringing back these old toys. Ultimately they come up with a conclusion that will change the way they look at toys forever.
The documentary is a mixture of styles drawn from both the classic documentaries and modern documentaries. In some scenes the film extensively uses visual graphics while in others it tries to capture the ""moment"" as it actually happens such as the unrehearsed verity of them as they search for their old toys in a toy warehouse.
The search of the two film makers does not only bring nostalgia or memories back to the children of the 1980's, but it also gives a timely assessment and analysis which brings a new perspective into how we should a look at significant objects from our past.",CARTOON CHARACTERS IN FILMS,fil,Doc.,0:29:24,"Baizas, Ricky; Cayetano, Lino ","Baizas, Melecio; Baizas, Violeta; Cayetano, Renato; Cayetano, Sandra; Baizas, Ricky; Cayetano, Lino; Martinez, Boy; ","Velasco, Jovenal D.

Ang pamilya ay itinuturing na pundasyon ng ating lipunan. Ito ang pinakapangunahing elemento o bahagi ng isang bubong na kung tawagin ay lipunan. Sa kanya kumita ng liwanag ang mga kaisipang nagpabago, nagpapabago, at magpapabago sa ating kapaligiran. Salamin din ito ng namamayaning kultura at mahahalagang pangyayari sa ating mga buhay. Ito ang tanggulan ng isang kaluluwang naligaw ng landas o ng isang tinig na nagkamit ng tagumpay. Bawat kasapi ay may isang mahalagang bahaging ginagampanan. Ang ama ang haligi, ang ina ang ilaw, at ang anak ang mga anghel na nakasilong sa mapagpalang mga kamay ng mga magulang Bawat kasapi ay kabilang sa milyon-milyong indibidwal na may sariling mundong ginagalawan na kapag nagsama-sama ay maaaring pagmulan ng isang maganda o hindi magandang kahihinatnan

Pangunahing layunin ng pelikulang ito ang maipahiwatig ang saloobin ng pagtutol sa pagiging patriarkal ng ating lipunan. Nais nitong maipakita ang paghiling ng pagkakapantay-pantay ng lalake at babae bakla o tomboy. Ang pagtutol sa ideolohiyang patriarkal ay matagal nang nagsimula, ngunit hanggang ngayon ay hindi pa rin lubusang nakakamit ang kanilang layunin. Ang pelikula ay nagtatangka na kahit papaano ay makatulong sa patuloy na pakikipaglaban ng mga kababaihan at mga bakla sa ating lipunan.

As we examine ourselves and our way of living, we cannot in anyway say that life for us is perfect. Just when we thought everything is going right for us, we notice a certain stain that blots out and voids whatever good there is left in us. Such is life's harsh reality.

""Liyab"" is the story of a fireman who saves lives and homes but fails to save his own. His wife is having an affair with another man. His feigned tolerance of this consuming heat eventually leads to a catastrophic end for all of them. This is the irony of living. We often notice the flaws of others and yet, we fail to recognize our own. When we do, we find drastic measures thinking we can correct it, which we often fail to do.

There is an inner struggle for man to be truly good. However, when he is asked to live this out and when forced to prove this goodness, he often fails.

Nekyia means ""descent into hell"". It is a term used by Carl Jung when he refers to Picasso's work. He regards it as an important process in the development of a person. For only by undertaking this journey could an individual ever hope to come to terms with himself/herself. The journey is what our lead character had to go through in this film.

The film revolves around our lead character looking at herself in front of the mirror as she recalls her experiences. Each part of her face is a symbol of what she went through. Her different experiences and the choices she made, make up all the puzzles in her face. She may have acquired her eyes from her mother but the rest is a result of her way of adjusting to her environment and the way she chose to be. She explores and discovers reality and as she becomes part of it by learning things and acquiring those parts from those experiences. Her hideous face is a symbol of what we all are underneath our pretenses. This is the fact that no matter how revolting our experiences may seem to be, these are the things that make us whole and beautiful. The ugliness that we have underneath is what makes us truly human and unique in our own way.

The film is shot using a Hi-8 video camera with overlays of 3d animation since I feel that the best way to show the development of the face of the character would be through this medium.

The thesis is about the story of a poor boy whose loss of his first bought property motivated him to strive hard in life. The story is based on the premise that oftentimes to the materially deprived, even the means of escape from their humdrum experience is a luxury they could hardly afford.

There was a boy living with his mother in a small rented house owned by a rotten landlady. Juanito, the boy, got to own a bicycle which to him was his first source of power and escape from all of life's miseries. Due to some circumstances, the boy lost this first bought property to their wicked landlady as payment for his mother's obligations. The recurring recollections of his bicycle led him to pursue a better life.

This thesis production is a 12-minute digital video narrative on the inherent discrimination against lesbians, particularly in the workplace. It focuses on a teacher as she goes through the struggles of being a lesbian in a conservative environment.

The plot takes place in an exclusive for girls' Catholic school where the two main characters work as teachers. Set in a religious environment, both work hard to keep their jobs and their identity intact. The point of the story is that even though they are good in their chosen profession, they were dismissed because of their innate sexuality.

According to Richard Murnane and Frank Levy, ""...only workers with skills needed in new, good jobs will participate in the prosperity accompanying economic growth. This idea is supported by the Human Capital Theory which discusses the role of individual citizens and their personal success which contribute to the development of the nation as a whole.

Education plays a vital role in providing individuals with a good life. In lieu with this, the Department of Education Culture and Sports (DECS) and the U.P. Pahinungod with their volunteer program Gurong Pahinungod reach out to the less fortunate members of the society and help in giving them education that will help them survive the highly society.

Now that even the far flung areas of the country are open to the trading community, many of the elders in these areas are still illiterate.
unable to perform basic mathematical skills vital in the everyday life of provincial business trading.

One of the programs within the Gurong Pahinungod is the Adult Literacy Program which aims to help barrio elders gain the knowledge needed in their trade.

To conquer this problem of illiteracy, competent and dedicated volunteer teachers are needed. But so far. there has been a dwindling number of volunteers each year who are willing to immerse themselves for one year in the province. Coupled with the 'budget cut' affecting the university and in effect, lowering the allotted budget for U.P. Pahinungod, Gurong Pahinungod Program included, recruitment has been dry. Inadequacy of volunteers is now fast becoming an obstacle for the organization now that there is an increasing demand for volunteers In many areas.

Supported by interviews and actual shots of the activities in the program, this documentary focuses on the need for competent and dedicated volunteer teachers showing how they address the illiteracy problem in Sitio Addang, Paracelis. Mt. Province.

Perlas is a story of pain, of greed, revenge, of basic human nature, and of women. The story is relatively simple, there is nothing extraordinary about it. In fact I’m sure everyone knows of a story, which is similar to one portrayed in Perlas. This is because it happens all the time.
Yet, the way that story has come together in the person of Pina in short films Perlas, and the circumstances chosen to dress up the story parents for us a new perspective from which to view this age old story of pain and suffering.

Tingnan mo sa mapa ang pulo ng Luzon, doon sa pinaka-norteng bahagi, yung dulong- dulong kuntil na nakausli sa karagatang Pasipiko. Isipin mong bigla kang mapunta sa lugar na iyon kung saan walang konsepto ng Makati o kaya'y Ortigas, Kung saan ang oras ay hindi natatakda ng orasan kundi natutukoy lamang ng pagbubukang-liwayway o ng pagdadapit-hapon, o kaya'y ng pagpalaot at ng pagdaong ng mga mangingisda sa dalampasigan.

Ito ang mga bagay na isinaalang-alang sa paggawa ng dokumentaryong ito. Sa pinaka- dulong bahagi ng Pilipinas, paano nga ba ang buhay ng mga tao doon na libu-libong kilometro mula sa kinaroroonan natin? Anu-ano ang umiimpluwensya sa pangaraw-araw nilang buhay? Paano nilang hinaharap ang bawat pagbukang-liwayway at anong mga hamon ang pinaghahandaan sa bawat dapithapon?

Ang dokumentaryong ito ay isang tahimik na pagmamasid sa buhay ng mga tao sa bayan ng Palauig Sta. Ana, Cagayan kung saan ang pangunahing hanapbuhay ng mga tao ay pangingisda. Si Mang Johnny, isang residente ng bayan ang nagsilbing gabay ng dokumentasyon.

The documentary takes off from the filmmaker's sentiments about her brother Mike who is a member of Akrho Pinoy. He, along with Arjay of Tau Gamma Pinoy and Mark of Flipside give their reasons for joining the gang. They say it is to fulfill the human need to belong especially in a foreign land. Their reasons are compared to Jeff's, a 28-year-old former active member of the Satanas Gang, one of the first Filipino gangs in Los Angeles. He said the purpose of the gang used to be about protecting Filipinos against other races but this has changed over the years. Today, the Filipino gangster in Los Angeles is capable of harming a rival Filipino gangster, a gangmate and even an ordinary Filipino with nothing to do with a gang. This is illustrated through several cases presented in the documentary. Arjay tells the story of Carlo, a gangmate who got killed during a drive-by shooting. FOX 11 Network News covers an event involving the Asian Boyz Gang which picked on one of their own members at a park in Downey, California. Aurora, now former girlfriend of one this documentary's subjects Arjay, sued him for abuse of former spouse/fiance. This thesis, being personal, wraps up with the filmmaker wishing that her gangster brother Mike will learn from Arjay who is currently in jail. The director used some experimental techniques to keep the viewers interested in the documentary. She felt that such treatment would fit the subject matter. The documentary aims to present to the viewer the irony of the fact that although Filipinos almost automatically bond with fellow Filipinos in a foreign country, here in the documentary, they appear to be capable of harming their kind.

Title: Kulambo


Format: VHS


Genre: Narrative Estimated Length: 13 minutes 7 seconds


The earth can only support 529 million people. At present, our population is 10 times over that figure. Therefore, the more mouths to feed, the more food is taken from the land which speeds up the deterioration of the soil, turning it into a wasteland. The faster the population grows, catastrophes of every type are now predestined to occur in the future.' Since the demands for raw materials continuously increase, technological and industrial advancement increase as well to satisfy the growing market. With advanced technology, these natural resources are stripped off from the environment in larger amounts quickly and leaving pollutants in the process and does not give nature enough time to replenish those resources. If this practice continues then it is possible that the earth will reach the state where no flora or fauna can survive because of the pollution. This is the state of the earth where the story of Kulambo evolves.


Kulambo takes place in the future where a child is forced to stay in the middle of a barren desert with only her mother as her companion. The net is where they have to live to protect them from the whirling dust. Anak, the main character of the film, only learns about nature through Nanay's stories which makes her feel jealous and cheated. Everyday, she and Nanay have to go on through the same routine of storytelling, playing, and eating whatever provision they have left to survive. But things change when Nanay discovers that their food provisions won't be enough for both of them.

The film also touches on the impressionability of youth during formative years that whatever they become in the future greatly depends on the perception of life they had as a child. We attempted to show this through our opening sequence. We relate this to the state of being of the 3 interviewees as a child before their lives were completely affected by the trauma they had with a certain elementary teacher. As graduating film students we would like to give our own kind of tribute to the people apart from our parents who have been beside us most step of the way - our teachers. Our film won't idealize fictional teachers, in fact our film does not praise teachers in an obvious way.

When she goes home for a visit her father makes an advance towards her and as she fights him off, she is given a chance to kill him and to avenge the injustice that was done to her. In the end, she decides against it. There are three characters in this film. The first is the father. He is 45 years old. He is a lawyer and is very dictatorial. Next is the mother who is 40 years old. She has a very weak personality and she just lets her husband push her around. Lastly, the daughter, Laura, is a graduating journalism student. She lives away from home and is at their house for a short visit. The story starts with the daughter, Laura, unpacking her things on the bed. Her mother enters and tries to strike up a conversation but to no avail. Reluctantly, the mother leaves the room. Once she was alone, Laura remembers the time when she was a kid and she ran to her father, who at that time was cleaning his gun. Her father leaves to give her a surprise, a doll. The first encounter between father and daughter takes place in the dining room during dinner. In this scene, the tension between the two becomes obvious. It also shows that the father considers the mother insignificant by not giving importance to the things that she was saying. Shortly before sunrise, the mother enters Laura's room and tells her that she is about to leave for her retreat. She also reminds Laura to take care of her father for the meantime. After dinner, the father once again tries to make a pass at Laura. She pushes her father away and runs to grab the gun that he placed on the stand before dinner. While Laura points the gun at her father, several flashbacks of Laura when she was a child are shown. These flashbacks are intercut with shots of the mom at the retreat house. The film ends with Laura deciding not to kill her father and then she leaves. A shot of the little girl standing outside her parents' room is the final shot. This particular shot is recurring throughout the whole film. This concept of not killing the father was brought about by the idea that she wanted Laura to have a psychological advantage over her father. She already had the power to kill him but she simply decided not to. Although her father victimized her, killing him will not resolve anything. ""Bagabag"" was shot in 16mm film and will run for about 12 minutes.","RAPE IN FILMS, FAMILY IN FILMS",fil,Nar.,10min,"Guidote, Rina; Tumangan, Mayumi","Tadena, J.A.; Guidote, Rina; Tumangan, Mayumi; de la Torre, Raz","Alfonso, Grace Javier ",2000,"Manila, Philippines",14.65677,121.0672,UPFI Student Thesis AV Collection,UPFI000081,Image;MovingImage,image/jpeg,2024-01-04 (Created),2000_Bagabag.m4v,Educational use only,https://mainlib.upd.edu.ph/university-archives/revised-policy-on-access-to-theses-and-dissertations-2017/

They have to face each other for the final confrontation because the hitman is the typical macho sort who thinks nothing of having some floozies on the side. And the woman is not the type to take that kind of behavior with emotional weakness or passiveness. As they face each other guns drawn and ready to be used, in the great Oceanic city of Hyperion, the hitman accidentally shoots down a flying dolphin, which knocks him off the gargoyle he is perched on. He falls to the street hundreds of stories below. The purpose of this thesis is create a film that encompasses many elements taken from my personal taste in film, which is that of genre movies, like sci-fi or gangster flicks. Even (and in some cases, most especially) cheap ones. It also contains elements of anime and comic book influences. Hyperion Waikiki Bang Bang was animated on a dual 233 Pentium workstation with 325 Mb of memory and 10 Gigs or more of hard disk space. The Poser 3 animation program from MetaCreations was used at first, before the Poser 4 from the same company was released. Some elements were modeled in the 3D Studio Max program, and then imported into the Poser. Although animated using a 3D animation program, the film was given its distinctive 2D look by rendering the sequences in the Poser 3's sketch mode. The Poser 4 contained a far more advanced version of the sketch mode, but the Poser 3's original sketch style was the look I felt most suited the story and the planned sequences. The background sky was done in Photoshop, and given movement in Adobe Premiere, while gunshot effects came from the AfterEffects program. The style is comic book-like, with the characters sometimes resembling figures drawn by comic book artists David Mazzuchelli or Keith Giffen. Certain scenes are done with a pseudo-anime touch, although the overall visual style may be likened to a kind of cinematic cartoon noir. A certain B-Movie flavor is also introduced through the use of a somewhat cheesy Hawaiian music soundtrack, hence the Waikiki in the title, also contributing to the overall pastiche effect, making it a weird neo-Hawaiian anime noir, if such a thing can ever exist. The other part of the soundtrack is composed of electronica tracks done on the MTV Music Generator on the Sony Playstation game console, reflecting some video game influences, as well as certain new films such as Run, Lola, Run (1999). So I guess that I would call it postmodern - it is after all a pastiche of many different styles and influences, and not all of them from the film medium.",FUTURISM AND THE CINEMA ,fil,Ani.,4:28,"Padilla, Johann","Padilla, Johann; Ballesteros, Jobin; Vinuan, Reggie","Alfonso, Grace Javier ",2000,"Manila, Philippines",14.65677,121.0672,UPFI Student Thesis AV Collection,UPFI000083,Image;MovingImage,image/jpeg,2024-01-04 (Created),2000_HyperiodWaikikibang-bang.m4v,Educational use only,https://mainlib.upd.edu.ph/university-archives/revised-policy-on-access-to-theses-and-dissertations-2017/

The political set-up of most families has always been patriarchal. Traditionally, the father, ""the main man of the house"", is recognized as the supreme authority who has control not only of his own life, which he may conduct as he pleases, but also of other family members Gradually, even the use of violence is accepted as an allowable form of discipline and as an inevitable means to exert power and control until the intensity of the violence becomes unlimited and life-threatening

This basic premise is used in the construction of the thesis. It attempts to show the connection between domestic violence and the patriarchal system, ie how patriarchy supports and reinforces the use of violence within the family. More specifically, it is the story of a sibling violence victim who is forced to keep quiet about the violent incidents experienced inside the house while struggling to maintain her sense of balance outside and get on with her ambitions in life.

Lumangoy, Lumutang revolves around a girl who finds herself competing in a man's world & realizes that to live need not comply with a system that adheres to the standards of men.

The girl, Siday, loses in a band competition to a bunch of guys. She is subjected to sexist remarks and taunts from male members of her family. She retreats into her room for days, playing her guitar. She repeatedly does not get a certain note right. She falls asleep and is jolted back into her dreams. In her dreams, she is presented with fear of water that she has never experienced in her waking moments. She is thrashing wildly in open sea, with no sign of land nearby. She discusses her recurring dreams with her mother, who gives her encouraging remarks of being her own woman. Her mother, however, has resigned to be a housewife despite finishing college with a degree in medical sciences. This fact disappoints Siday and does not appreciate her pieces of advice.

One night, Siday's mother finally practices what she preaches by announcing at the dinner table that she plans to be independent by getting a job. This then truly inspires Siday to decide to work out her own demons of self- pity by practicing her craft. She starts plucking her guitar while recalling her dreams of almost drowning. She still makes the same mistakes over until finally,her thoughts of drowning is severed; she starts to relax in the water while her tempo is sustained. Her playing finally hits the right note.

Siday realizes that even in the arena of competition with men, she does not succeed, she will always be a winner with herself. She need not be taken over by fear before she even begins. The scene with her playing guitar her room fades out. A few seconds of her floating on the water flashes on the screen will show that she has achieved inner peace.

BAKUNA NI KAMATAYAN is a documentary on death penalty in our country. It focuses on the issue that it is not a deterrent to crime. 
The documentary was shot in video-8 handycam and edited using non- linear editing. Its running time is 14 minutes and 19 seconds. 
The documentary shows the two contrasting views of people involved in the issue: the Pro and Anti- Death Penalty advocates, In this project, we answer the question: Is death penalty a deterrent to crime? 

First of the reasons given by the Anti- death penalty camp is that it is inhuman, it is against the right to life. Secondly, it is unchristian. It is against our claim that we are a christian nation and yet we practice a barbaric form of punishment. Lastly, it is unjust. We know for a fact that mostly poor people go to jail. They cannot afford to hire good lawyers to defend themselves. Also, mostly, innocent victims who are framed-up go behind bars for crimes they did not commit. Capital punishment, the anti-death penalty advocates claim, is not a deterrent to crime. ""When a person is in the full heat of passion,"" said Sen. Miriam Defensor-Santiago in our interview with her, ""whether you have a death penalty or not does not affect his decision to commit a crime anyway."" 
On the other hand, three arguments are put forward by those who are still in favor of the death penalty. First, it is a deterrent to crime. Second, capital punishment is a requirement for justice. And third, it is a legitimate defense of the state against the harmful elements that pose a threat to the welfare of society. 
As filmmaker-researchers and partners, it is our purpose to convince the audience that whatever form of capital punishment, violent or not, does not solve the problem of the increasing crime rate. It is inflicted to avenge a wrong done --- perceived as heinous --- by one of its member to another member or to the state in general.",CRIME IN FILMS,fil,Doc.,14:28,"Martinez, Mart Anne A. & Maria Eloisa C.

Through the years, the balisong has been a symbol of the Batangueños. It plays a major part in Batangas history, tradition and its people's lifestyles. Being a Batangueño who grew up in Manila, the filmmaker has always been intrigued on how a particular product has created so much impact on the cultural group where it belongs. The filmmaker found it very interesting to take an in-depth look on the balisong and its effects on the identity, lifestyle and way of thinking of the Batangueños.

""BALISONG"" is a 13-minute video documentary that presents the balisong as an important cultural symbol for the Batangueños more than being a deadly weapon or a mere souvenir item. The filmmaker traces the beginnings, development and present state of the balisong industry and its step-by-step manufacturing process. The filmmaker also interviewed several Batangueños and an anthropologist to further explain the role of the balisong on the culture of the Batangueños.

  Through images and sound bytes, the filmmaker aims to show the real meaning of the balisong to the Batangueños.

Being a Batangueño himself, the filmmaker chose a personal approach on the treatment of the documentary. The filmmaker. through his voice over narration, deals with the subject using the first person point of view. This documentary has a casual and informal tone as if a Batangueño narrating to a non-Batangueño. It also made use of a musical score, the Kumintang, which is also native to the province.

If I were to define my thesis in one phrase, it would be this:


""A glimpse at a young man's journey in life""


Entitled ""Biyahe"", my thesis is in narrative format and runs for approximately 14 minutes. I utilized the use of the montage technique and preferred to make the entire narrative in black and white primarily for two reasons. First is to dramatize that the events took place in the past and second is to create and achieve that film look despite of its being in Video 8 format.


""Biyahe"" is inspired by the story of my boyfriend, Seth - an only child who never knew his father since birth. Throughout his life, he felt he was empty and so he joined an organization, which offers friendship, and most importanly, brotherhood.


However, he did not get through. The men he thought were his ""brothers"" beat


him to death. He died on the last initiation night.


Seth's dreams were never fulfilled. His hopes flew and never will they return.


But for me and for all the people, who knew Seth in one way or another, believe that he was complete - as a son, as a friend, as a person. Only he did not realize this because of his thirst for the love of a stranger - his unknown father. The father he never saw haunted his young life.


If only Seth knew that the man he tried to find all his life was not worthy of his affections.


My thesis is not just about Seth. It is for him, for his journey, for his life, for his


dreams…

Title: Bloodline

Genre: Experimental Format: Video

Length: 12 minutes


Parents are a child's first teachers. They are the ones who teach a child his first word, his first step and how to do things on his own for the first time. They teach the child how to tie his shoes, use the toilet bowl, sing a nursery rhyme, and recite the alphabet.


Parents are a child's highest authority. This is not only part of our culture, but it is taught by religion as well -- children should obey and honor their parents. Parents are said to know better than the children do. They are said to know what is right from wrong.


Parents are a child's greatest influence. Being the first people that a child sees during his formative years, parents have a greater hold on their children than anyone else does. During his early years of development, his parents are his only role models.


This will be a stylized film using red, white and black as the dominant colors. In this film, red is the representation of the blood relation between the main characters in the film. Yet, they will be seen dressed in white. White is the representation of nothingness, a state where one is free from connection and obligation from other people, even their family. Black is the representation of impurity.


The filmmaker's use of the fourth commandment-- ""Honor thy father and thy mother."" - as a repeating voice-over is a representation of the influence of religion on the notion that parents should teach children and children should follow their parents more than anyone else. It is taught by religion, whether Catholic or not, that disobedience is man's greatest sin to his parents.


The cigarette is not only used a technique for continuity; it is shown as a form of outlet from stress, frustration and dissatisfaction for the characters in the film. The use of the fish in a bowl is a representation of being trapped in a small space where standards are set. It is to represent the child being trapped in the standards of his parents and being limited to the norms of the society, particularly to obedience to parents. The pollution of the water in the bowl is a representation of the child's rebellion and misbehavior. The killing of the fish is a representation of the child's desire to escape. The parents' inability to recognize their child's dilemma led the child to eventually become like her parents. At the end of the film, it is revealed that she will treat her child the same as her parents have treated her.

She has scars all over her body, scars from wounds inflicted by others, and scars from wounds inflicted by her self.

All she ever learned as a child was how to swallow her pains and pretend everything was alright. Her mother would punish her, beat her up and plant lies in her head. Lies like she never deserved love from anyone, lies like she was to blame for anything that ever goes wrong, lies like she was evil, and lies like even God does not love her. So she grew up bitter and angry, believing in these lies.

All the hate she had that she could not take out on her mother she took out on herself. She rebelled; she would do things she knew her mother would never approve of just to hurt her mother, not caring that she hurt herself more. She got a tattoo, and chose the design of the 'Madonna and Child'. A mocking dedication to her mother, and her God

The situation at home never got better as she grew older, in fact, it was getting worse. Her mother was getting more and more deranged and she could not take it anymore. Fighting back is not an option because no matter how much she wanted to, it was not in her. She just couldn't because she was paralyzed from the power her mother had over her. So, she just runs away.

Time passes and she seems to be getting on with her life. A life of her own, far away from her mother, far away from the home she escaped from, far away from the past which seems to be just like a horrible nightmare now. Then her life takes another turn.
Her mother is dying and she has to come home. She does not want to, but she has to, and she does. So back she goes to the home she escaped from and sees how the tables have turned. She is the strong one now, and her mother is weak. Still, she feels nothing for her mother. No love, not even pity. All she ever felt for the woman was hate and all she ever did was keep it inside

Maybe she became too good at keeping her hate inside that it went away Maybe all she really feels now is nothing, nothing at all. But a dream proves her wrong.

In the dream, her mother is back to her old self, the cruel, angry woman she hated and feared. Only this time, she is not afraid of her anymore. She musters all the years of suppressed hate and takes action. In a rage, she kills the woman. She kills the source of all the hate she ever had. And she cannot believe it. Is she supposed to feel triumphant? Guilty? Afraid? All she knows is that she is confused.

She wakes up. Looking at her is the dying woman she killed in her dreams, and all she can do now is help the woman die. Her mother asks to die in peace and she has no choice but to let her.

Now all she is left with are the painful memories her mother gave her. All she is left with is the unresolved hate that will never have the chance to be retaliated. All she is left with are the wounds of the past that has never healed.

She heals herself. By reopening the wounds and unleashing her Pandora's box of resentments, she begins. Through her art, she cleanses her wounds, and frees herself.",HUMAN RELATIONS IN FILM,fil,Exp/Nar.,10:30,"Arguelles, Doanne","Arguelles, Gus, Rivera, Ra

Title: ART


Format: 16mm


Genre: experimental


Running time: 6 min 25 sec


When people attend art events such as exhibits, it is presumed that they are there for the same reasons as true art lovers and fans, which are to enjoy and to celebrate the beauty of art. However, we have often observed that there are also those who go to these events for the wrong reasons. They go to be seen, or to see who else is going, or even to find out what people are wearing. Also, it often appears as if ""art talk"" is more important than art itself, and consequently, the value of art is buried under a stack of chitchat, personal opinions, and definitions of what art is. We believe that how one appreciates and defines art is a very personal and subjective matter.


Although we are aware that there are those who truly esteem art for all its merits, we are concerned with how the said observations are negatively affecting art itself by upholding the impression that art is only there for an exclusive crowd or for those who claim to ""understand"" it. This short experimental film sharply deals with the subject and allows the viewer to be his own critic.

This short film, based on the filmmaker's own experience, deals with a family whose patriarch has an affair. We see how this crisis affects the members of the family and their relationships with each other. The viewer is taken through a scenes loosely centred on the family table, from dinner time to late into the night. The ticking of a clock threads through the film, as scenes move from one to the next, suggestive of the swing of the family's pendulum clock. However, as events unfold, the ticking sound and the chiming of the clock seem to be counting down and tolling to the eventual disintegration of family ties.

In our human mortality, the loss of people we love is inevitable... just as our own impending death in the future is inevitable. The cycle of life, and death, continues in and around us, whether we are conscious of it or not, and independent of our own perceptions and beliefs. And as no one is exempted from death, so too are we not exempted from the grief brought about by death. The loss of people who are dear to us is never easy, thus a struggle ensues in such an experience.


Andy is one such story of one man's struggle against the personal loss brought about by death, a story wherein every one of us can relate to, sooner or later in our own life. Though stricken with grief, hopelessness, and frustration, he eventually came to a point where he needed to choose: life or death? In this short film, as it is in real life, the character's eventual triumph is an act of will and determination, to continue to go on living.

""Joy Ride, the proposed film is in 16 mm color. It is a 7 minute narrative based on a real life experience when I got held up in a grocery store and lost my cellular phone. The film am about to make is a dark comedy of what happened to me in real life. Here, I am going to exaggerate the blame that I have received from friends and family after the incident


The film is a small episode of Boy's life as he comes home late after a hold- up, where he really didn't lose anything. Boy's materialistic family asks him to narrate the entire incident. By the time the family learns that the hold-upper threatened Boy to give up his cellular phone, the family starts proposing steps that Boy should've taken in order to avoid the incident. After each family member gets a chance to assert him or herself, they argue in front of Boy. Boy snaps, tells his family to leave him alone, and goes back to his room.


After Boy's response falls on his materialistic family's deaf ears, he changes by overindulging himself on the past incident, and by deciding to start a more aggressive, and assertive treatment towards his materialistic family.


The film attempts to understand people's tendency to blame others, by juxtaposing the real incident as narrated by its protagonist Boy, and the blame or the proposed solutions by each family member, with the dining table conversation happening at present

Ang Prinsipe at Ang Prinsesa (Sa Kaharian ng mga Papel na Bulaklak) is a 10-minute narrative shot in 16mm. The takeoff point of the story is a kind of tribute to Antoine De Saint- Exupery's The Little Prince. ""It is only with the heart that one can see rightly; what is essential is invisible to the eye."" These are the kinds of hearts and eyes that childhood has not lost in their purity and innocence. And this is what the film is all about.

A child's heart is one full of hopes. He has the capacity for being dazzled and awestruck by the simple wonders of the world around him. And he can imagine the future springing with hope, in a kind of childlike, naïve faith, even when it bears little resemblance to the present.

Childhood is a well-worn path stretching across every life,

as it is impossible to go through with life without treading that road. The film is an invitation to the audience to once again retrace their steps and review the sights and sounds of childhood. The film is a bid to come along to the places where we once lived and to touch the things that really mattered. It is a call to go back to the invisibles of life, the essentials of life. And you know that it goes without saying, there's a child deep inside always playing.""

“Kasyamento” is about Clara, a court stenographer, and Rafael, a young man who is having his marriage annulled. The two from a transitory but meaningful friendship beyond the halls of the court as both of them go through very different trials in life.
 The film deals with the notion of “law”, as it “operates” in the social realities of marriage, annulment and love. But “Kasyamento”, instead of being defines and restricted by the rules of the love story, explores love beyond romantic love and the triangle formulas. The film uses a legal framework (Family Code of the Philippines or Executive Order 209) in conjunction with a reworking and engagement of the romance genre and the conventional expectations this genre cues.
“Kasyamento”, is a brave attempt to feature courtroom drama and love story combined. It discerns the capacity of new breeds to tackle the most important issue in Filipino society. It permits a different view on the courtroom which is often misrepresented in other media. The story of a stenographer and an estranged husband comes as a fresh perspective that exist in the contemporary setting, where the law of marriage and annulment in the Philippines is represented in its most truthful sense.

Much had been said and written about marriage. This thesis project joined the long list of books, fiction and non-fiction, television programs, and motion pictures that had dealt with the subject of love and lifelong commitments. In this short narrative entitled Tuloy?, Lisa, the main character, was confronted with the not-so-romantic face of marriage just moments before her own wedding. The unhappiness that the failed marriages inflicted on the people closest to her, and the possibility that her own marriage might meet the same sad fate caused Lisa to seriously reconsider her decision. In a show of will, Lisa reaffirmed her decision, thereby acknowledging the unknown future.

The concepts for the framework were borrowed from the Social Exchange Theory of John Thibaut and Harold Kelley, from the books about marriage as written by Paul Landis, by Constance L. Shehan and Kenneth C.W. Kammeyer, by Judson T. Landis and Mary G. Landis, and by Maxine Rock to name a few.

The production thesis project has an approximated running time of 13 minutes and was shot in digital video.

Title: transit

Genre: Narrative Format: DV

Length: 26 mins. 55 sec.

transit is a magnified look at a critical phenomenon in a young couple's life, which is a depiction of the archetypal exploring male and the predicament of the female/mother who is left behind, all situated in the present society. It is a story which attempts to show the movement of both characters' viewpoint at that particular occurrence, a 'slice of real life' represented, focusing on the details of their condition as they try to construct a transition in finding a desired identity. It takes on an understated form of drama that shows the separate directions of their lives. Like the contradictions of the traditional and the modern, the romantic and the pragmatic, the male and the female- one sets out to explore and to find inspiration through physical journey, through leaving home, through escape and wandering, while the other is left with her own passage through a sense of purpose and assertiveness, confronting the hard facts of her present condition. This is a story of both of their journeys and their outcome, a crossing point between the images of the two genders found through a reversal of their roles.

The Objective of this work is to find through its structure, new ways of presenting a story in video, an attempt to show movement in different forms. It is a synthesis of modern video technology with the physical attributes of a purely mechanical item such as the typewriter. This sort of marriage between a classical and modern tool for storytelling is used to show another way of presenting a journey, and to present it along with the idea of writing while traveling. The motion of the camera, in the manner a typewriter's platen moves, works as a substitute to the actual physical movement done by the character, and provides us the sense that distance is gained through every strike of its keys.

In another aspect, the video is also an attempt to show two kinds of artistic tendencies typified into the two sexes. The male represents that of the romantic, ideal, and spontaneous who is associated with such traditional tool as a typewriter, while the female represents the pragmatic and the modern, who makes her journey through finding a job in the internet.

My thesis entitled, ""Kadugo"" mirrors my life as a victim in my own home. Through its experimental treatment, this thesis manifests the inner workings of the mind of a young woman in the peak of her adolescent years. As a product of a broken family, I has been suffering the psychological and emotional baggage weighed down by the painful treatment of her family particularly her half sister 
Existing under the shadows of a domineering half sister, the character never wins attention and high regard over her half sister's seemingly perfect disposition despite the fact that she is an academic achiever. Being unhappy and silenced by her half sister's intimidation, she is left to suppress the hurt, anger and hatred thus, motivating her to cease her antagonist's existence only in her thoughts. Unable to express the negative emotions within her, she translates her repressed anger through a journey seeing a lot of fast and chaotic movements and kills her step-sister through the distortion of the perfect Barbie doll, being the embodiment of the step-sister. In the end it is seen that in spite of all the hatred, anger and other mixed emotions the character felt due the differences she has with her half sister, there is still a road leading to forgiveness and acceptance. embodiment of the step-sister.

Ang ""Makina ng Manggagawa ay isang anim (6) na minutong animation na mapapanood sa video. Ito ay tumatalakay sa kalagayan ng mga manggagawa sa kasalukuyang sistemang kapitalismo. Ipinapakita sa pelikulang ito na kung sino ang may-ari ng kasangkapan sa produksyon, bagamat wala siyang partisispasyon, ay siya lamang ang nakikinabang ng mga yamang nalilikha. Siya ang makapangyarihan, ang may kontrol sa lahat ng nasasakupan. Ang ganitong kaayusan ang dahilan ng paghihiwalay ng mga tao sa uri. Mga uri na lagi't laging nagtutunggalian.

Ang itsura ay dalawang (2) dimensyunal. Itim puti at abo ang kulay sa simula. Sa umpisa ay makikita ang close-up ng iba't-ibang bahagi ng isang makina. Makikita rin ang mga bahagi ng katawan ng isang tao. Ang kabuuan ng makina ay nakadikit sa katawan ng manggagawa na nagpapatakbo nito. Ang makina at manggagawa ay tila isang entidad. Hindi malinaw kung saan ang hangganan ng dalawa. Ang makina na ito ay lumilikha ng mga malaking butil ng bigas. Mayroong isang maliit na tubo na naghuhulog ng karampot na tipak ng bigas. Nalalaglag ito sa bibig ng manggagawa at ito ang kanyang ikinabubuhay. Ang makina at manggagawa ay hindi lang iisa. Marami sila na lumilikha ng malalaking butil. Marami sila na nabubuhay sa karampot na tipak. Ang mga butil na nalilikha ay kinakain ng mga mala-ahas na nilalang na galamay ng isang malaki at nakasisindak na halimaw. Mayroon itong matalim na pangil, malaking mata at mahabang dila na ginagamit panghagupit sa mga manggagawa. Masusugatan ng dila ng halimaw ang isang manggagawa sa dibdib at bubulwak ang malapot na pulang dugo, Kakalat ito sa katawan ng manggagawa at tutunawin ang bigkis niya sa makina. Kakalat pa ang pulang dugo sa iba pang manggagawa hanggang sa lahat sila ay nakahiwalay na at hindi na nagtatrabaho. Ang mga kamay nila ay magiging espada na gagamitin sa pagputol sa mga mala-ahas na nilalang at pagpatay sa higanteng halimaw

Simple lang ang mensahe ng pelikula: Sa lipunang kapitalista, pinagsasamantalahan ng kapitalista ang manggagawa sa pamamagitan ng pagkontrol sa kasangkapan sa produksyon. Ang ganitong bulok na kaayusan ay dapat wakasan at ang makakapagsagawa lamang nito ay ang mismong pinagsasamantalahan.

The film is entitled ""Ugoy"" in reference to the ""ugoy ng duyan"" which is when a baby is put inside a crib, resembling a hammock, and is rocked back and forth. The steady rhythm keeps the baby calm and eventually puts it to sleep. In that same sense, the only time people with OCD feel at ease is when they succumb to his or her obsessions that have become their own rhythm and daily routine. The film also tackles the relationship between a mother and a son. Undeniably, mothers play a very important role in child rearing. More often than not, if not always, the most influential figure in a child's life, especially during the formative years, is his mother, probably because of the unique bond formed between them beginning at conception. His mother usually teaches the basic knowledge that a person needs to get through life. The line ""mothers know best surely didn't materialize out of nowhere. This film tries to tap into this relationship but in a different light. While it is a mother's genuine care and love for her child that 'makes' him, ironically, it is also what can 'break' him, as the filmmakers will attempt to show in this film.

Two heads may be better than one in achieving a work but in this short film, it shows that a group is not ideal at all times. However, people do not really understand that. Instead like all group efforts, filming is tedious, strenuous and disagreements are likely to occur. It can hold true even on the mere creative process.

The characters, Ina, Karen and Bryan will show you all the excitement that is involved in making a short film.

""SINO AKO?""

Ang pagkakakilanlan ng tao bilang miyembro ng kanyang lipunan ay hindi agad-agad matatamosa araw ng kanyang kapanganakan, kundi kinakailangan niyang matutunan ito mula sa kanyang karanasang pansarili at pangkapwa. Ito ang tinutukoy nating identity na sumasaklaw sa personal, sosyal, historikal, sikolohikal at pang-ekonomiyang kaganapan ng ating pagkatao. Ang pisikal na batayan at ""function"" ng isang tao ay bahagi lamang ng kaganapang ito, hindi superpisyal lamang sa pagkakaroon ng legal na pangalan, kundi ng isang malalim na kaugnayan sa kaniyang pinaggalingang magulang at sa maternal na lipunan ng tao.

Ang mga magulang ang pangunahing tagapag-ugnay sa identity ng tao, kung kaya't ang isa o parehong pagliban sa pagpapalaki ng supling ay mangangahulugang kawalang kaganapan ng identity. Ang pundasyon ng kanyang pagkatao ay marupok at mistulang walang katuparan sa kanyang lipunan. Kung kaya't pilit na binabalikan at sinusuri ng tao ang kanyang kasaysayan at pinagmulan - sino ang identity ng kanyang mga magulang?

Ang paghahanap sa kanyang identity ang karaniwang pinakamatayog na mithiin ng tao. Sapagkat ang mga bakas ng kanilang identity ay limitado sa nakalipas, ang mga maliliit na patunay ng identity ng kaniyang mga magulang ay magsisilbing tagpi-tagping balabal na susuutin ng supling sa araw-araw. Ito ang katuturan ng kanyang pagkatao.

Double Happiness is a film about a Chinese woman raised in the Philippines, who plans of marrying a Filipino and decides whether to conform or go against the traditional custom of Chinese marriage without losing her being Chinese. It shows the modern approach on how a Chinese engagement is conducted and yet, maintains the traditional elements contained in a typical Chinese engagement. The film emphasizes on the weight of the more important value: either to maintain the traditional endogamous patterns of mate selection and thus aligning oneself with parental desire and a greater probability of marriage success, or to break through cultural barriers in the ultimate demonstration of independence and democratic idealism and have the supposedly exciting experience of marrying someone ""different.""

This film shares the fact that the unity of many Chinese families has been cemented or irrevocably destroyed by the issue of the parents' capacity to veto the selection of their child's spouse. It aims to reach out to the audience specifically those traditional Chinese people that intercultural marriage such as Filipino-Chinese Intermarriage should be considered and accepted as an expected and normal practice of marriage.

The fact remains that a family is the basic social unit of society.

Despite the differences of men and women, the two are still trying to share their lives together. Although misunderstandings keep them apart, they still try to live their lives in harmony. They get into a commitment and get into a series of more complications. Things aren't always easy and magical, yet somehow, love is there to bind the two together.

Past experiences - triumphs or failures - mold a person to what she is now. Belief in something one thought she knew may be changed once she goes through that experience. When one thought love is all about happiness and bliss, later she'll find out that it actually isn't.

This story is a product of what has been lived through. Though the genre gives the impression that it is fictional, it is as a matter of fact, real. This is about a guy running away from his supposed-to-be bride on their wedding day, later for him to realize that indeed he needs her though it's a little too late because the girl doesn't want to get into a commitment either.
Inspired by a number of films, this film is avant-garde. With a mixture of comedy, horror, and fantasy, the film illustrates how reality bites.",MARRIAGE IN FILMS,fil,Nar.,15:51,"Dolotallas, Marichelle L.; Venturina,  Joanne E..","Dolotallas, Mamerto III, Venturina, Policarpio; Atenecio, Janice; Guillermo, Rodolfo; Cuntapay, JoMarie; Venturina, Joanne","Piano, Eduardo",2002,"Manila, Philippines",14.65677,121.0672,UPFI Student Thesis AV Collection,UPFI000129,Image;MovingImage,image/jpeg,2024-01-04 (Created),2002_PasintabiPag-ibig.m4v,Educational use only,https://mainlib.upd.edu.ph/university-archives/revised-policy-on-access-to-theses-and-dissertations-2017/

This ten-minute video documentary is about my realization of the importance of education. It is about how some teachers, who are genuinely concerned about the welfare of the students, affect and touch the lives of others. Lastly, it also shows how I was transformed from being a student in class to a student in life.

My pursuit of a diploma and the realization of its value are facilitated by my interactions with my professor and some high school students who are educationally ""less privileged"" than I am.

The religious devotee who surrenders her faith to God believing

that the Lord shall always provide.

The fan who trusts her idol to always be there for her in return for

her unwavering patronage and support.

The lotto addict who wagers a bet almost everyday in the hope of

making it big someday.

Three characters who stake their lives on faith and trust -- hoping someday that the deity, person or thing they have faith in would someday come through for them. Never wavering in their devotion even if the objects of their faith most of the time fail to give them what they want. They would fight for this faith believing that it is their only chance in life. Always believing that their continued patronage would never be overlooked - that they will soon have what they wished for, that they will soon get what is due them.

Hope from overwhelming faith..

Hope that borders on delusion.

Hope that can cause a revolution in the believer if it fails to deliver the dream at the end.
