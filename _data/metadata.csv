In the beginning, there was the ""Collective Subconscious"", a video concept in an eight-part series of video shorts (2-5 minutes each) presenting narratives abstracts about life, death, growth, environment, love, sex, religion, and personal values and/or principles. Each with its own set of storyline, characters and filmic distinction that is totally unrelated and disconnected from each other; but generally, unified by one theme that of indifference. or
But ""Collective Subconscious"" finished (even in writing). never came to be
In its stead came the concept of ""Dreamwalker""; a three-part video production patterned after the ""Collective Subconscious"". Consisting of three video shorts unrelated and disconnected from each other; but generally embraced by the theme of indifference that unifies them. The first two are poems and the third is a narrative non-genre. They are titled: Dreams and Although ""Dreamwalker"" has reached its first rough cut stage, it still has to be dropped, or its first two parts discontinued, and leave the third part to stand alone. To become the final version of the concept that started with eight, and now, that is left to only one. In the beginning, there were eight, and in the end, there was only One.
