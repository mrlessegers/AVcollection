In the beginning, there was the ""Collective Subconscious"", a video concept in an eight-part series of video shorts (2-5 minutes each) presenting narratives abstracts about life, death, growth, environment, love, sex, religion, and personal values and/or principles. Each with its own set of storyline, characters and filmic distinction that is totally unrelated and disconnected from each other; but generally, unified by one theme that of indifference. or

In its stead came the concept of ""Dreamwalker""; a three-part video production patterned after the ""Collective Subconscious"". Consisting of three video shorts unrelated and disconnected from each other; but generally embraced by the theme of indifference that unifies them. The first two are poems and the third is a narrative non-genre. They are titled: Dreams and Although ""Dreamwalker"" has reached its first rough cut stage, it still has to be dropped, or its first two parts discontinued, and leave the third part to stand alone. To become the final version of the concept that started with eight, and now, that is left to only one. In the beginning, there were eight, and in the end, there was only One.

With the aim of contributing in the dissemination of knowledge concerning the damage being done to our surroundings, Ms. Cabusao and Ms. Macasaet chose to make an environmental thesis production. production Wanting to produce an environmental different from the usual pollution and illegal loggings, the two thought of doing one on coral reefs. And after deliberating over the best possible way of realizing said project, Ms. Cabusao and Ms. Macasaet finally decided that they could better visualize the coral reefs by using the technique of animation.
The two were joined by two other students, Ms. Sherida Castilla and Ms. Elaine Lazarito, who were having difficulties with their own topic proposal. So much so that Ms. Cabusao and Ms. Macasaet offered the two to join the group in making the animation. Thank God Ms. Castilla and Ms. Lazarito agreed to make the group a foursome.
Nightmares (Are Made Of...), Anyone Lived in A Pretty How Tawn (by E.E.Cummings), and One, respectively.
But Dreamwalker has to be dropped.
Both concepts (Collective Subconscious and Dreamwalker) aim to produce visually, or in video, certain feelings emotions, moods, characteristics, attitudes, more with the unconventional use and and manipulation of the camera, the lights, and the editing equipments; and less with the characters and the script itself.
Moreso, both concepts aim to make use of collected, unrelated footages, distorted shots, and flat frames; and then montaging them to create a simple (even basic), yet unconventional approach to the expression of everyday and often taken-for-granted sentiments of people. a
Both are a great challenge for a filmmaker, and both are exciting filmically as student much as literarily. But both are difficult (even complex) for a student with very limited resources. The magnanimity of the work to be done (in all the aspects of production), the financing to be made, the casting to be arranged; coupled with the wideness of scope of the shooting and all the camera work that has to be achieved could all have been a drain of time, money, and effort for a lone student filmmaker. Reason enough to cut concepts to their utmost limits.

""Dreams Deferred"" is a video documentary about gifted children in the Philippines. Traditionally, the ""special"" children who have been given attention in this country have been the ones on the other extreme of the spectrum: the handicapped, or mentally/physically challenged. Special children who are exceptionally intelligent or talented-- gifted-- have been assumed to be able to take care of themselves. After all, they are gifted. In a country short on resources, they have no choice but to fend for themselves.
This mistaken notion has resulted in a great loss of opportunity for the Philippines. One can only imagine what they might have been able to achieve for the development of the nation had their gifts been properly nurtured. This documentary is an attempt to focus attention on this often ignored and little explored subject.
Recently, the media particularly broadcast and print media have trained the spotlight on the gifted. In the past months and years articles have been written and segments have been done in mainstream newspapers and television shows. Gifted children even became the theme of a national advertising campaign for a product (Promil) by a major company (Wyeth-Suaco). All these efforts have done much to place the education of the gifted in the national consciousness.
This thesis is an attempt to contribute to that effort. Its title takes its inspiration from a poem by Langston Hughes, written from the point of view of a black child in America wondering if his dreams will ever be fulfilled given the enormous obstacles he faces as a marginalized member of his society. Through the use of well-organized and creative visuals, the documentary explores the challenge posed to gifted children in a country which can offer so little in terms of resources, infrastructure, and other kinds of support. This filmmaker's hope is that it will educate its viewers about the issues and questions involved in the subject of gifted children. Though seemingly not as urgent as other national issues, the author believes that it is a significant one which deserves priority. Its target audience is everyone-- students of all fields, parents, professionals, educators who, collectively and in their own ways, could have an impact on the way gifted chidren are viewed and treated in the Philippines.

ISANG SILIP is a video narrative that combines soft-core science fiction with contemporary crime drams. It is a hypothetical fast forward to a time when all the ""What ifs"" could come true. The narrative paints a cold and harsh look into the future of Philippine society where someday, violence may be condoned and accepted as a means to claim justice.
Despite the stark and cynical backdrop, ISANG SILIP presents a touch of humanity in its story line, a spark of hope in the form of one's quest for freedom and redemption. The filmmakers have set out to prioritize this element by stressing the dramatic flow, in order to create a certain ""human side"" to the narrative and at the same time make the film uniquely different from other science fiction movies. As a result, the narrative has an amalgam of different genres. The danger in a virtually lawless society, the lonely search for a new beginning and the future's satirical bite make ISANG SILIP truly exceptional in itself.
Throughout time, humanity has valued freedom highly. The film reflects this quality in the persona of the lead character, whose motive is to seek liberation. The narrative as a whole conveys human angst, a feeling of loneliness and desolation, revenge and redemption, hate and desire.
The film will embody what media has inadvertently portrayed--a world of consuming violence. People have been left with little or no control over what is being fed to them. This narrative is an answer to those who present brutality onscreen. ISANG SILIP gives a dose of the reality that people are being influenced by this violence, somehow.

What this research aims to uncover is nothing especially new in the sense that this has been topics of discussions ever since. It aims to point out how we have been greatly influenced by the Spaniards further, even after colonizing us, imprinting upon us their culture. This great transformation, despite its presence today, is mixed with other strong influences. The question now is this: what is truly Filipino? We have been led to believe that the conservative attitude is what is truly Filipino while the liberal attitude is what is modern and foreign. But actually, as proven by the book Pagsusulatan nang Dalauang Binibini na si Urbana at ni Feliza na Nagtuturo ng Mabuting Kaugalian by Padre Modesto de Castro in 1864, we have been influenced into a culture, arguably was dictatted by the book. Thus the Filipino concept of 'perfect housewives, ""lady-like', and 'walang-modo', and so on, have been based on a constructed culture written by a Spanish priest. So the question again stands: What is truly Filipino?
After having read Ambeth Ocampo's books, Rizal Without the Overcoat and Looking Back, the researcher/filmmaker has realized that there are so much more interesting facts about our culture and our history than what was learned in school and at home. This interest was furthered by the book Pagsusulatan nang Dalauang Binibini na si Urbana at ni Feliza na Nagtuturo ng Mabuting Kaugalian written by Padre Modesto de Castro in 1864. This book was found to be particularly interesting not only because it was trying to dictate social norms (which today, in comparison, would be far-fetched), but also because it was in this period that the social norms today began.
This thesis intends to re-present and reflect upon the kind of culture that we have today; tracing its roots to the 19th century, the age of Maria Clara and religious fanaticism. This historical flashback aims to help the audience to understand the origins of this culture.

The thesis of the documentary is that a lesbian can assimilate herself in society given the love and support her nuclear family.
In Philippine society, the individual does not exist independently from his family. The family live in such a way that its members learn to care and take responsibility of each other. And as the case may be, the individual values acceptance within the family more than he values acceptance within society.
The researchers of this study believe that when a family member is ostracized by society for being homosexual, the family, especially the younger siblings, bears the brunt of social castigation. This pernicious attitude towards the homosexual compels the family to defend the individual. Should the family defend the individual, they also go through the painful process that the homosexual undergoes.

When ""Paalam"" was still being written, the writers' main purpose was to pay a final tribute to their loved ones who had just passed away. It will be their last gift. their final good-bye and thank you to the special and treasured memories of beloved parents and a cherished grandfather. However, when the script entered its final draft, the writers' discovered other dimensions to the film's objectives.
The narrative is dedicated to the writers' relatives who have moved on but it is also for those who are left behind. ""Paalam"" aims to help enlighten the minds of the people who underwent similar experiences, that grief. no matter how painful, can never be quantified. Also, the film's other goal is to help guide the friends of the mourners as to how they should relate with them. Death is painful, it is tragic and traumatic but after watching ""Paalam"" it is the writers hope that viewers will see death not as an absolute despair but rather hopeful.

In a 1986 study by Theresa C. Carino entitled, Chinese Women in Manila: Changing Roles and Perceptions, she compared two generations of Philippine Chinese women, 20 college girls and their mothers. She was surprised to find that while the daughters had higher career aspirations than their mothers, both generations still believed home management to be an exclusively female domain. Also, while these women described men in general as ""intelligent, had leadership attributes, were agressive, logical, self-confident, ambitious, competitive and competent,"" they described themselves with adjectives commonly associated with the subordinate sex: 1 ""intelligent, sensitive, faithful, honest, emotional, religious, submissive, and gentle."" Obviously, a difference in ages or generation does not necessarily mean a difference in views. Is it the culture then, that makes these women think this way? And of course, there are those little, big signs that everyone sees everywhere. That ad in the paper, making one believe: Woman! Skinnier is better. That cutesy actress in that cutesy film with her wondah-ful clothes and mah-velous hats. What woman can resist the urge to splurge after that? And that song. Are girls just Barbie girls, to be undressed anywhere? There must be a conspiracy in media to make women feel bad about themselves. Is it any wonder that it is so hard for a woman to gain self-worth?
HerStory traces the history of Joan, a 23-year old woman of Chinese descent. It is Joan's story of how she lost and found herself. But man is never the enemy.

Life and love between two brothers living the pressures of growing up in the 90's. The two brothers are very close when growing up but their differences and age gap causes their separation. The love tries to be maintained but their love for one another fades away with time due to the problems of life (parental & peer pressure & substance abuse). The story also tackles the theme of irony and how these pressures can affect this brotherly love that can result into tragedy.

""Manyika is a three-minute experimental film about a woman's worth in a conservative society's eyes. It is a commentary on how a woman is expected to be nothing more than a doll, willing to be manipulated by the demands to conform to the standards of the social structure she is born and confined into.
Our film is a study of contrasts between the only two options a Filipina is damned into. She can either be the angel- the innocent, pure epitome of the mores; or the slut- a dirty woman, unworthy of anyone's respect. This, in a world where there are few, if rare, exceptions. Society is quick to judge, preferring the vulnerable, innocent angel that it can freely manipulate to the unwed, non-virgins. In our opinion, both personas are less than ideal and are both limiting to a woman's potential. A woman's worth therefore, is so mistakenly judged by the existence of that fragile sheath of skin between her legs and not by her strengths, talents or capabilities. Her chastity or lack thereof has nothing to do with who she is, but sadly it has everything to do with what society sees her to be. It doesn't have to be one or the other. There are gradations of color between white and red, and it is time people started to see and appreciate the variety of color that lies between them.",PROSTITUTES IN FILM,fil,Expe. ,4:02,"Padilla, Karen Marie P.; Tenorio, Maria Lourdes S.","Padilla, Ramoncito; Padilla, Mary Ann; Tenorio, Antonio; Tenorio, Lirio; Lee, Ruben; Padilla, Karen; Cruz, Glenn; Factora, Mylene; Macas, Audrey;","De Guzman, Anne Marie G.

During the span of one week, she experiences the difficulty that comes with being overweight and the pressure that society puts on being thin and beautiful. In the end, she realizes that the only ways to feel good and have fun is to accept herself as she is. The reason why I chose this topic for my thesis is because the issue of being overweight in a thin society has been confronting me all my life. I have tried everything to lose weight but nothing worked. The so-called problem is in my genes but society doesn't want to accept that. They would rather think of fat people as being lazy slobs who eat all day. I am sick of trying to measure up to society's standards of beauty.

Ang aking tesis na isang maikling naratibong pinamagatang ""Paglisan"" ay tungkol sa mga ala-ala ng isang ina sa kanyang kaisa-isang anak na babae na humiwalay na sa kanya. Isang pagsilip sa buhay ni Nicole (ang ina) sa pamamagitan ng pagbukas ng isang pahina sa kanyang buhay talaan - ang kanyang pinakatatagong diary. Sa pagdaloy ng pelikula ay malalaman nating noong ipinagbubuntis pa lamang ni Nicole ang kanyang anak ay gusto na itong ipalaglag o patayin ni Miguel, ang kanyang asawa. Ngunit hindi siya napilit nito at itinuloy pa rin niya ang pagbubuntis hanggang sa maipanganak nga niya si Denerisa.
Mula pagkabata ni Denerisa ay hindi na siya pinakitaan ng pagmamahal ng ama niya. Nariyang sinasaktan siya ng pisikal maliban sa emosyonal na pagpapasakit nito sa anak sa pagtanda. At bilang isang ina ay ang tanging maipapalit niya sa mga sakit na ito ay ang kanyang pagaaruga, paguunawa at pasensya.
Hanggang sa makapagtapos na ang kanyang anak. Sa araw ng pagkamit ng diploma ng anak, naaalala niya ang mga pangyayaring nagsilbing sanhi ng mga sakit at galit na rin mula sa anak para sa ama. At sa pagalis ng kanyang anak ay hinahangad niya ang isang buhay na punong-puno ng ganap na pagmamahal, isang buhay na kailanman ay hindi natagpuan ng anak sa sariling pamilya.

The documentary follows the search of two film students as they look for their old toys and old memories. In the process they interview fellow children of the 1980's and discover that they are not alone in their search, it seems that others are remembering and feel the need to bring their old toys back as well. This leads them to interview certain people who could help explain their fascination with bringing back these old toys. Ultimately they come up with a conclusion that will change the way they look at toys forever.
The documentary is a mixture of styles drawn from both the classic documentaries and modern documentaries. In some scenes the film extensively uses visual graphics while in others it tries to capture the ""moment"" as it actually happens such as the unrehearsed verity of them as they search for their old toys in a toy warehouse.
The search of the two film makers does not only bring nostalgia or memories back to the children of the 1980's, but it also gives a timely assessment and analysis which brings a new perspective into how we should a look at significant objects from our past.",CARTOON CHARACTERS IN FILMS,fil,Doc.,0:29:24,"Baizas, Ricky; Cayetano, Lino ","Baizas, Melecio; Baizas, Violeta; Cayetano, Renato; Cayetano, Sandra; Baizas, Ricky; Cayetano, Lino; Martinez, Boy; ","Velasco, Jovenal D.

Ang pamilya ay itinuturing na pundasyon ng ating lipunan. Ito ang pinakapangunahing elemento o bahagi ng isang bubong na kung tawagin ay lipunan. Sa kanya kumita ng liwanag ang mga kaisipang nagpabago, nagpapabago, at magpapabago sa ating kapaligiran. Salamin din ito ng namamayaning kultura at mahahalagang pangyayari sa ating mga buhay. Ito ang tanggulan ng isang kaluluwang naligaw ng landas o ng isang tinig na nagkamit ng tagumpay. Bawat kasapi ay may isang mahalagang bahaging ginagampanan. Ang ama ang haligi, ang ina ang ilaw, at ang anak ang mga anghel na nakasilong sa mapagpalang mga kamay ng mga magulang Bawat kasapi ay kabilang sa milyon-milyong indibidwal na may sariling mundong ginagalawan na kapag nagsama-sama ay maaaring pagmulan ng isang maganda o hindi magandang kahihinatnan

Pangunahing layunin ng pelikulang ito ang maipahiwatig ang saloobin ng pagtutol sa pagiging patriarkal ng ating lipunan. Nais nitong maipakita ang paghiling ng pagkakapantay-pantay ng lalake at babae bakla o tomboy. Ang pagtutol sa ideolohiyang patriarkal ay matagal nang nagsimula, ngunit hanggang ngayon ay hindi pa rin lubusang nakakamit ang kanilang layunin. Ang pelikula ay nagtatangka na kahit papaano ay makatulong sa patuloy na pakikipaglaban ng mga kababaihan at mga bakla sa ating lipunan.

As we examine ourselves and our way of living, we cannot in anyway say that life for us is perfect. Just when we thought everything is going right for us, we notice a certain stain that blots out and voids whatever good there is left in us. Such is life's harsh reality.

""Liyab"" is the story of a fireman who saves lives and homes but fails to save his own. His wife is having an affair with another man. His feigned tolerance of this consuming heat eventually leads to a catastrophic end for all of them. This is the irony of living. We often notice the flaws of others and yet, we fail to recognize our own. When we do, we find drastic measures thinking we can correct it, which we often fail to do.

There is an inner struggle for man to be truly good. However, when he is asked to live this out and when forced to prove this goodness, he often fails.

Nekyia means ""descent into hell"". It is a term used by Carl Jung when he refers to Picasso's work. He regards it as an important process in the development of a person. For only by undertaking this journey could an individual ever hope to come to terms with himself/herself. The journey is what our lead character had to go through in this film.

The film revolves around our lead character looking at herself in front of the mirror as she recalls her experiences. Each part of her face is a symbol of what she went through. Her different experiences and the choices she made, make up all the puzzles in her face. She may have acquired her eyes from her mother but the rest is a result of her way of adjusting to her environment and the way she chose to be. She explores and discovers reality and as she becomes part of it by learning things and acquiring those parts from those experiences. Her hideous face is a symbol of what we all are underneath our pretenses. This is the fact that no matter how revolting our experiences may seem to be, these are the things that make us whole and beautiful. The ugliness that we have underneath is what makes us truly human and unique in our own way.

The film is shot using a Hi-8 video camera with overlays of 3d animation since I feel that the best way to show the development of the face of the character would be through this medium.

The thesis is about the story of a poor boy whose loss of his first bought property motivated him to strive hard in life. The story is based on the premise that oftentimes to the materially deprived, even the means of escape from their humdrum experience is a luxury they could hardly afford.

There was a boy living with his mother in a small rented house owned by a rotten landlady. Juanito, the boy, got to own a bicycle which to him was his first source of power and escape from all of life's miseries. Due to some circumstances, the boy lost this first bought property to their wicked landlady as payment for his mother's obligations. The recurring recollections of his bicycle led him to pursue a better life.

This thesis production is a 12-minute digital video narrative on the inherent discrimination against lesbians, particularly in the workplace. It focuses on a teacher as she goes through the struggles of being a lesbian in a conservative environment.

The plot takes place in an exclusive for girls' Catholic school where the two main characters work as teachers. Set in a religious environment, both work hard to keep their jobs and their identity intact. The point of the story is that even though they are good in their chosen profession, they were dismissed because of their innate sexuality.

According to Richard Murnane and Frank Levy, ""...only workers with skills needed in new, good jobs will participate in the prosperity accompanying economic growth. This idea is supported by the Human Capital Theory which discusses the role of individual citizens and their personal success which contribute to the development of the nation as a whole.

Education plays a vital role in providing individuals with a good life. In lieu with this, the Department of Education Culture and Sports (DECS) and the U.P. Pahinungod with their volunteer program Gurong Pahinungod reach out to the less fortunate members of the society and help in giving them education that will help them survive the highly society.

Now that even the far flung areas of the country are open to the trading community, many of the elders in these areas are still illiterate.
unable to perform basic mathematical skills vital in the everyday life of provincial business trading.

One of the programs within the Gurong Pahinungod is the Adult Literacy Program which aims to help barrio elders gain the knowledge needed in their trade.

To conquer this problem of illiteracy, competent and dedicated volunteer teachers are needed. But so far. there has been a dwindling number of volunteers each year who are willing to immerse themselves for one year in the province. Coupled with the 'budget cut' affecting the university and in effect, lowering the allotted budget for U.P. Pahinungod, Gurong Pahinungod Program included, recruitment has been dry. Inadequacy of volunteers is now fast becoming an obstacle for the organization now that there is an increasing demand for volunteers In many areas.

Supported by interviews and actual shots of the activities in the program, this documentary focuses on the need for competent and dedicated volunteer teachers showing how they address the illiteracy problem in Sitio Addang, Paracelis. Mt. Province.

Perlas is a story of pain, of greed, revenge, of basic human nature, and of women. The story is relatively simple, there is nothing extraordinary about it. In fact I’m sure everyone knows of a story, which is similar to one portrayed in Perlas. This is because it happens all the time.
Yet, the way that story has come together in the person of Pina in short films Perlas, and the circumstances chosen to dress up the story parents for us a new perspective from which to view this age old story of pain and suffering.

Tingnan mo sa mapa ang pulo ng Luzon, doon sa pinaka-norteng bahagi, yung dulong- dulong kuntil na nakausli sa karagatang Pasipiko. Isipin mong bigla kang mapunta sa lugar na iyon kung saan walang konsepto ng Makati o kaya'y Ortigas, Kung saan ang oras ay hindi natatakda ng orasan kundi natutukoy lamang ng pagbubukang-liwayway o ng pagdadapit-hapon, o kaya'y ng pagpalaot at ng pagdaong ng mga mangingisda sa dalampasigan.

Ito ang mga bagay na isinaalang-alang sa paggawa ng dokumentaryong ito. Sa pinaka- dulong bahagi ng Pilipinas, paano nga ba ang buhay ng mga tao doon na libu-libong kilometro mula sa kinaroroonan natin? Anu-ano ang umiimpluwensya sa pangaraw-araw nilang buhay? Paano nilang hinaharap ang bawat pagbukang-liwayway at anong mga hamon ang pinaghahandaan sa bawat dapithapon?

Ang dokumentaryong ito ay isang tahimik na pagmamasid sa buhay ng mga tao sa bayan ng Palauig Sta. Ana, Cagayan kung saan ang pangunahing hanapbuhay ng mga tao ay pangingisda. Si Mang Johnny, isang residente ng bayan ang nagsilbing gabay ng dokumentasyon.

The documentary takes off from the filmmaker's sentiments about her brother Mike who is a member of Akrho Pinoy. He, along with Arjay of Tau Gamma Pinoy and Mark of Flipside give their reasons for joining the gang. They say it is to fulfill the human need to belong especially in a foreign land. Their reasons are compared to Jeff's, a 28-year-old former active member of the Satanas Gang, one of the first Filipino gangs in Los Angeles. He said the purpose of the gang used to be about protecting Filipinos against other races but this has changed over the years. Today, the Filipino gangster in Los Angeles is capable of harming a rival Filipino gangster, a gangmate and even an ordinary Filipino with nothing to do with a gang. This is illustrated through several cases presented in the documentary. Arjay tells the story of Carlo, a gangmate who got killed during a drive-by shooting. FOX 11 Network News covers an event involving the Asian Boyz Gang which picked on one of their own members at a park in Downey, California. Aurora, now former girlfriend of one this documentary's subjects Arjay, sued him for abuse of former spouse/fiance. This thesis, being personal, wraps up with the filmmaker wishing that her gangster brother Mike will learn from Arjay who is currently in jail. The director used some experimental techniques to keep the viewers interested in the documentary. She felt that such treatment would fit the subject matter. The documentary aims to present to the viewer the irony of the fact that although Filipinos almost automatically bond with fellow Filipinos in a foreign country, here in the documentary, they appear to be capable of harming their kind.

Title: Kulambo


Format: VHS


Genre: Narrative Estimated Length: 13 minutes 7 seconds


The earth can only support 529 million people. At present, our population is 10 times over that figure. Therefore, the more mouths to feed, the more food is taken from the land which speeds up the deterioration of the soil, turning it into a wasteland. The faster the population grows, catastrophes of every type are now predestined to occur in the future.' Since the demands for raw materials continuously increase, technological and industrial advancement increase as well to satisfy the growing market. With advanced technology, these natural resources are stripped off from the environment in larger amounts quickly and leaving pollutants in the process and does not give nature enough time to replenish those resources. If this practice continues then it is possible that the earth will reach the state where no flora or fauna can survive because of the pollution. This is the state of the earth where the story of Kulambo evolves.


Kulambo takes place in the future where a child is forced to stay in the middle of a barren desert with only her mother as her companion. The net is where they have to live to protect them from the whirling dust. Anak, the main character of the film, only learns about nature through Nanay's stories which makes her feel jealous and cheated. Everyday, she and Nanay have to go on through the same routine of storytelling, playing, and eating whatever provision they have left to survive. But things change when Nanay discovers that their food provisions won't be enough for both of them.

The film also touches on the impressionability of youth during formative years that whatever they become in the future greatly depends on the perception of life they had as a child. We attempted to show this through our opening sequence. We relate this to the state of being of the 3 interviewees as a child before their lives were completely affected by the trauma they had with a certain elementary teacher. As graduating film students we would like to give our own kind of tribute to the people apart from our parents who have been beside us most step of the way - our teachers. Our film won't idealize fictional teachers, in fact our film does not praise teachers in an obvious way.

When she goes home for a visit her father makes an advance towards her and as she fights him off, she is given a chance to kill him and to avenge the injustice that was done to her. In the end, she decides against it. There are three characters in this film. The first is the father. He is 45 years old. He is a lawyer and is very dictatorial. Next is the mother who is 40 years old. She has a very weak personality and she just lets her husband push her around. Lastly, the daughter, Laura, is a graduating journalism student. She lives away from home and is at their house for a short visit. The story starts with the daughter, Laura, unpacking her things on the bed. Her mother enters and tries to strike up a conversation but to no avail. Reluctantly, the mother leaves the room. Once she was alone, Laura remembers the time when she was a kid and she ran to her father, who at that time was cleaning his gun. Her father leaves to give her a surprise, a doll. The first encounter between father and daughter takes place in the dining room during dinner. In this scene, the tension between the two becomes obvious. It also shows that the father considers the mother insignificant by not giving importance to the things that she was saying. Shortly before sunrise, the mother enters Laura's room and tells her that she is about to leave for her retreat. She also reminds Laura to take care of her father for the meantime. After dinner, the father once again tries to make a pass at Laura. She pushes her father away and runs to grab the gun that he placed on the stand before dinner. While Laura points the gun at her father, several flashbacks of Laura when she was a child are shown. These flashbacks are intercut with shots of the mom at the retreat house. The film ends with Laura deciding not to kill her father and then she leaves. A shot of the little girl standing outside her parents' room is the final shot. This particular shot is recurring throughout the whole film. This concept of not killing the father was brought about by the idea that she wanted Laura to have a psychological advantage over her father. She already had the power to kill him but she simply decided not to. Although her father victimized her, killing him will not resolve anything. ""Bagabag"" was shot in 16mm film and will run for about 12 minutes.","RAPE IN FILMS, FAMILY IN FILMS",fil,Nar.,10min,"Guidote, Rina; Tumangan, Mayumi","Tadena, J.A.; Guidote, Rina; Tumangan, Mayumi; de la Torre, Raz","Alfonso, Grace Javier ",2000,"Manila, Philippines",14.65677,121.0672,UPFI Student Thesis AV Collection,UPFI000081,Image;MovingImage,image/jpeg,2024-01-04 (Created),2000_Bagabag.m4v,Educational use only,https://mainlib.upd.edu.ph/university-archives/revised-policy-on-access-to-theses-and-dissertations-2017/

They have to face each other for the final confrontation because the hitman is the typical macho sort who thinks nothing of having some floozies on the side. And the woman is not the type to take that kind of behavior with emotional weakness or passiveness. As they face each other guns drawn and ready to be used, in the great Oceanic city of Hyperion, the hitman accidentally shoots down a flying dolphin, which knocks him off the gargoyle he is perched on. He falls to the street hundreds of stories below. The purpose of this thesis is create a film that encompasses many elements taken from my personal taste in film, which is that of genre movies, like sci-fi or gangster flicks. Even (and in some cases, most especially) cheap ones. It also contains elements of anime and comic book influences. Hyperion Waikiki Bang Bang was animated on a dual 233 Pentium workstation with 325 Mb of memory and 10 Gigs or more of hard disk space. The Poser 3 animation program from MetaCreations was used at first, before the Poser 4 from the same company was released. Some elements were modeled in the 3D Studio Max program, and then imported into the Poser. Although animated using a 3D animation program, the film was given its distinctive 2D look by rendering the sequences in the Poser 3's sketch mode. The Poser 4 contained a far more advanced version of the sketch mode, but the Poser 3's original sketch style was the look I felt most suited the story and the planned sequences. The background sky was done in Photoshop, and given movement in Adobe Premiere, while gunshot effects came from the AfterEffects program. The style is comic book-like, with the characters sometimes resembling figures drawn by comic book artists David Mazzuchelli or Keith Giffen. Certain scenes are done with a pseudo-anime touch, although the overall visual style may be likened to a kind of cinematic cartoon noir. A certain B-Movie flavor is also introduced through the use of a somewhat cheesy Hawaiian music soundtrack, hence the Waikiki in the title, also contributing to the overall pastiche effect, making it a weird neo-Hawaiian anime noir, if such a thing can ever exist. The other part of the soundtrack is composed of electronica tracks done on the MTV Music Generator on the Sony Playstation game console, reflecting some video game influences, as well as certain new films such as Run, Lola, Run (1999). So I guess that I would call it postmodern - it is after all a pastiche of many different styles and influences, and not all of them from the film medium.",FUTURISM AND THE CINEMA ,fil,Ani.,4:28,"Padilla, Johann","Padilla, Johann; Ballesteros, Jobin; Vinuan, Reggie","Alfonso, Grace Javier ",2000,"Manila, Philippines",14.65677,121.0672,UPFI Student Thesis AV Collection,UPFI000083,Image;MovingImage,image/jpeg,2024-01-04 (Created),2000_HyperiodWaikikibang-bang.m4v,Educational use only,https://mainlib.upd.edu.ph/university-archives/revised-policy-on-access-to-theses-and-dissertations-2017/

The political set-up of most families has always been patriarchal. Traditionally, the father, ""the main man of the house"", is recognized as the supreme authority who has control not only of his own life, which he may conduct as he pleases, but also of other family members Gradually, even the use of violence is accepted as an allowable form of discipline and as an inevitable means to exert power and control until the intensity of the violence becomes unlimited and life-threatening

This basic premise is used in the construction of the thesis. It attempts to show the connection between domestic violence and the patriarchal system, ie how patriarchy supports and reinforces the use of violence within the family. More specifically, it is the story of a sibling violence victim who is forced to keep quiet about the violent incidents experienced inside the house while struggling to maintain her sense of balance outside and get on with her ambitions in life.

Lumangoy, Lumutang revolves around a girl who finds herself competing in a man's world & realizes that to live need not comply with a system that adheres to the standards of men.

The girl, Siday, loses in a band competition to a bunch of guys. She is subjected to sexist remarks and taunts from male members of her family. She retreats into her room for days, playing her guitar. She repeatedly does not get a certain note right. She falls asleep and is jolted back into her dreams. In her dreams, she is presented with fear of water that she has never experienced in her waking moments. She is thrashing wildly in open sea, with no sign of land nearby. She discusses her recurring dreams with her mother, who gives her encouraging remarks of being her own woman. Her mother, however, has resigned to be a housewife despite finishing college with a degree in medical sciences. This fact disappoints Siday and does not appreciate her pieces of advice.

One night, Siday's mother finally practices what she preaches by announcing at the dinner table that she plans to be independent by getting a job. This then truly inspires Siday to decide to work out her own demons of self- pity by practicing her craft. She starts plucking her guitar while recalling her dreams of almost drowning. She still makes the same mistakes over until finally,her thoughts of drowning is severed; she starts to relax in the water while her tempo is sustained. Her playing finally hits the right note.

Siday realizes that even in the arena of competition with men, she does not succeed, she will always be a winner with herself. She need not be taken over by fear before she even begins. The scene with her playing guitar her room fades out. A few seconds of her floating on the water flashes on the screen will show that she has achieved inner peace.

BAKUNA NI KAMATAYAN is a documentary on death penalty in our country. It focuses on the issue that it is not a deterrent to crime. 
The documentary was shot in video-8 handycam and edited using non- linear editing. Its running time is 14 minutes and 19 seconds. 
The documentary shows the two contrasting views of people involved in the issue: the Pro and Anti- Death Penalty advocates, In this project, we answer the question: Is death penalty a deterrent to crime? 

First of the reasons given by the Anti- death penalty camp is that it is inhuman, it is against the right to life. Secondly, it is unchristian. It is against our claim that we are a christian nation and yet we practice a barbaric form of punishment. Lastly, it is unjust. We know for a fact that mostly poor people go to jail. They cannot afford to hire good lawyers to defend themselves. Also, mostly, innocent victims who are framed-up go behind bars for crimes they did not commit. Capital punishment, the anti-death penalty advocates claim, is not a deterrent to crime. ""When a person is in the full heat of passion,"" said Sen. Miriam Defensor-Santiago in our interview with her, ""whether you have a death penalty or not does not affect his decision to commit a crime anyway."" 
On the other hand, three arguments are put forward by those who are still in favor of the death penalty. First, it is a deterrent to crime. Second, capital punishment is a requirement for justice. And third, it is a legitimate defense of the state against the harmful elements that pose a threat to the welfare of society. 
As filmmaker-researchers and partners, it is our purpose to convince the audience that whatever form of capital punishment, violent or not, does not solve the problem of the increasing crime rate. It is inflicted to avenge a wrong done --- perceived as heinous --- by one of its member to another member or to the state in general.",CRIME IN FILMS,fil,Doc.,14:28,"Martinez, Mart Anne A. & Maria Eloisa C.

Through the years, the balisong has been a symbol of the Batangueños. It plays a major part in Batangas history, tradition and its people's lifestyles. Being a Batangueño who grew up in Manila, the filmmaker has always been intrigued on how a particular product has created so much impact on the cultural group where it belongs. The filmmaker found it very interesting to take an in-depth look on the balisong and its effects on the identity, lifestyle and way of thinking of the Batangueños.

""BALISONG"" is a 13-minute video documentary that presents the balisong as an important cultural symbol for the Batangueños more than being a deadly weapon or a mere souvenir item. The filmmaker traces the beginnings, development and present state of the balisong industry and its step-by-step manufacturing process. The filmmaker also interviewed several Batangueños and an anthropologist to further explain the role of the balisong on the culture of the Batangueños.

  Through images and sound bytes, the filmmaker aims to show the real meaning of the balisong to the Batangueños.

Being a Batangueño himself, the filmmaker chose a personal approach on the treatment of the documentary. The filmmaker. through his voice over narration, deals with the subject using the first person point of view. This documentary has a casual and informal tone as if a Batangueño narrating to a non-Batangueño. It also made use of a musical score, the Kumintang, which is also native to the province.

If I were to define my thesis in one phrase, it would be this:


""A glimpse at a young man's journey in life""


Entitled ""Biyahe"", my thesis is in narrative format and runs for approximately 14 minutes. I utilized the use of the montage technique and preferred to make the entire narrative in black and white primarily for two reasons. First is to dramatize that the events took place in the past and second is to create and achieve that film look despite of its being in Video 8 format.


""Biyahe"" is inspired by the story of my boyfriend, Seth - an only child who never knew his father since birth. Throughout his life, he felt he was empty and so he joined an organization, which offers friendship, and most importanly, brotherhood.


However, he did not get through. The men he thought were his ""brothers"" beat


him to death. He died on the last initiation night.


Seth's dreams were never fulfilled. His hopes flew and never will they return.


But for me and for all the people, who knew Seth in one way or another, believe that he was complete - as a son, as a friend, as a person. Only he did not realize this because of his thirst for the love of a stranger - his unknown father. The father he never saw haunted his young life.


If only Seth knew that the man he tried to find all his life was not worthy of his affections.


My thesis is not just about Seth. It is for him, for his journey, for his life, for his


dreams…

Title: Bloodline

Genre: Experimental Format: Video

Length: 12 minutes


Parents are a child's first teachers. They are the ones who teach a child his first word, his first step and how to do things on his own for the first time. They teach the child how to tie his shoes, use the toilet bowl, sing a nursery rhyme, and recite the alphabet.


Parents are a child's highest authority. This is not only part of our culture, but it is taught by religion as well -- children should obey and honor their parents. Parents are said to know better than the children do. They are said to know what is right from wrong.


Parents are a child's greatest influence. Being the first people that a child sees during his formative years, parents have a greater hold on their children than anyone else does. During his early years of development, his parents are his only role models.


This will be a stylized film using red, white and black as the dominant colors. In this film, red is the representation of the blood relation between the main characters in the film. Yet, they will be seen dressed in white. White is the representation of nothingness, a state where one is free from connection and obligation from other people, even their family. Black is the representation of impurity.


The filmmaker's use of the fourth commandment-- ""Honor thy father and thy mother."" - as a repeating voice-over is a representation of the influence of religion on the notion that parents should teach children and children should follow their parents more than anyone else. It is taught by religion, whether Catholic or not, that disobedience is man's greatest sin to his parents.


The cigarette is not only used a technique for continuity; it is shown as a form of outlet from stress, frustration and dissatisfaction for the characters in the film. The use of the fish in a bowl is a representation of being trapped in a small space where standards are set. It is to represent the child being trapped in the standards of his parents and being limited to the norms of the society, particularly to obedience to parents. The pollution of the water in the bowl is a representation of the child's rebellion and misbehavior. The killing of the fish is a representation of the child's desire to escape. The parents' inability to recognize their child's dilemma led the child to eventually become like her parents. At the end of the film, it is revealed that she will treat her child the same as her parents have treated her.

She has scars all over her body, scars from wounds inflicted by others, and scars from wounds inflicted by her self.

All she ever learned as a child was how to swallow her pains and pretend everything was alright. Her mother would punish her, beat her up and plant lies in her head. Lies like she never deserved love from anyone, lies like she was to blame for anything that ever goes wrong, lies like she was evil, and lies like even God does not love her. So she grew up bitter and angry, believing in these lies.

All the hate she had that she could not take out on her mother she took out on herself. She rebelled; she would do things she knew her mother would never approve of just to hurt her mother, not caring that she hurt herself more. She got a tattoo, and chose the design of the 'Madonna and Child'. A mocking dedication to her mother, and her God

The situation at home never got better as she grew older, in fact, it was getting worse. Her mother was getting more and more deranged and she could not take it anymore. Fighting back is not an option because no matter how much she wanted to, it was not in her. She just couldn't because she was paralyzed from the power her mother had over her. So, she just runs away.

Time passes and she seems to be getting on with her life. A life of her own, far away from her mother, far away from the home she escaped from, far away from the past which seems to be just like a horrible nightmare now. Then her life takes another turn.
Her mother is dying and she has to come home. She does not want to, but she has to, and she does. So back she goes to the home she escaped from and sees how the tables have turned. She is the strong one now, and her mother is weak. Still, she feels nothing for her mother. No love, not even pity. All she ever felt for the woman was hate and all she ever did was keep it inside

Maybe she became too good at keeping her hate inside that it went away Maybe all she really feels now is nothing, nothing at all. But a dream proves her wrong.

In the dream, her mother is back to her old self, the cruel, angry woman she hated and feared. Only this time, she is not afraid of her anymore. She musters all the years of suppressed hate and takes action. In a rage, she kills the woman. She kills the source of all the hate she ever had. And she cannot believe it. Is she supposed to feel triumphant? Guilty? Afraid? All she knows is that she is confused.

She wakes up. Looking at her is the dying woman she killed in her dreams, and all she can do now is help the woman die. Her mother asks to die in peace and she has no choice but to let her.

Now all she is left with are the painful memories her mother gave her. All she is left with is the unresolved hate that will never have the chance to be retaliated. All she is left with are the wounds of the past that has never healed.

She heals herself. By reopening the wounds and unleashing her Pandora's box of resentments, she begins. Through her art, she cleanses her wounds, and frees herself.",HUMAN RELATIONS IN FILM,fil,Exp/Nar.,10:30,"Arguelles, Doanne","Arguelles, Gus, Rivera, Ra

Title: ART


Format: 16mm


Genre: experimental


Running time: 6 min 25 sec


When people attend art events such as exhibits, it is presumed that they are there for the same reasons as true art lovers and fans, which are to enjoy and to celebrate the beauty of art. However, we have often observed that there are also those who go to these events for the wrong reasons. They go to be seen, or to see who else is going, or even to find out what people are wearing. Also, it often appears as if ""art talk"" is more important than art itself, and consequently, the value of art is buried under a stack of chitchat, personal opinions, and definitions of what art is. We believe that how one appreciates and defines art is a very personal and subjective matter.


Although we are aware that there are those who truly esteem art for all its merits, we are concerned with how the said observations are negatively affecting art itself by upholding the impression that art is only there for an exclusive crowd or for those who claim to ""understand"" it. This short experimental film sharply deals with the subject and allows the viewer to be his own critic.

This short film, based on the filmmaker's own experience, deals with a family whose patriarch has an affair. We see how this crisis affects the members of the family and their relationships with each other. The viewer is taken through a scenes loosely centred on the family table, from dinner time to late into the night. The ticking of a clock threads through the film, as scenes move from one to the next, suggestive of the swing of the family's pendulum clock. However, as events unfold, the ticking sound and the chiming of the clock seem to be counting down and tolling to the eventual disintegration of family ties.

In our human mortality, the loss of people we love is inevitable... just as our own impending death in the future is inevitable. The cycle of life, and death, continues in and around us, whether we are conscious of it or not, and independent of our own perceptions and beliefs. And as no one is exempted from death, so too are we not exempted from the grief brought about by death. The loss of people who are dear to us is never easy, thus a struggle ensues in such an experience.


Andy is one such story of one man's struggle against the personal loss brought about by death, a story wherein every one of us can relate to, sooner or later in our own life. Though stricken with grief, hopelessness, and frustration, he eventually came to a point where he needed to choose: life or death? In this short film, as it is in real life, the character's eventual triumph is an act of will and determination, to continue to go on living.

""Joy Ride, the proposed film is in 16 mm color. It is a 7 minute narrative based on a real life experience when I got held up in a grocery store and lost my cellular phone. The film am about to make is a dark comedy of what happened to me in real life. Here, I am going to exaggerate the blame that I have received from friends and family after the incident


The film is a small episode of Boy's life as he comes home late after a hold- up, where he really didn't lose anything. Boy's materialistic family asks him to narrate the entire incident. By the time the family learns that the hold-upper threatened Boy to give up his cellular phone, the family starts proposing steps that Boy should've taken in order to avoid the incident. After each family member gets a chance to assert him or herself, they argue in front of Boy. Boy snaps, tells his family to leave him alone, and goes back to his room.


After Boy's response falls on his materialistic family's deaf ears, he changes by overindulging himself on the past incident, and by deciding to start a more aggressive, and assertive treatment towards his materialistic family.


The film attempts to understand people's tendency to blame others, by juxtaposing the real incident as narrated by its protagonist Boy, and the blame or the proposed solutions by each family member, with the dining table conversation happening at present

Ang Prinsipe at Ang Prinsesa (Sa Kaharian ng mga Papel na Bulaklak) is a 10-minute narrative shot in 16mm. The takeoff point of the story is a kind of tribute to Antoine De Saint- Exupery's The Little Prince. ""It is only with the heart that one can see rightly; what is essential is invisible to the eye."" These are the kinds of hearts and eyes that childhood has not lost in their purity and innocence. And this is what the film is all about.

A child's heart is one full of hopes. He has the capacity for being dazzled and awestruck by the simple wonders of the world around him. And he can imagine the future springing with hope, in a kind of childlike, naïve faith, even when it bears little resemblance to the present.

Childhood is a well-worn path stretching across every life,

as it is impossible to go through with life without treading that road. The film is an invitation to the audience to once again retrace their steps and review the sights and sounds of childhood. The film is a bid to come along to the places where we once lived and to touch the things that really mattered. It is a call to go back to the invisibles of life, the essentials of life. And you know that it goes without saying, there's a child deep inside always playing.""

“Kasyamento” is about Clara, a court stenographer, and Rafael, a young man who is having his marriage annulled. The two from a transitory but meaningful friendship beyond the halls of the court as both of them go through very different trials in life.
 The film deals with the notion of “law”, as it “operates” in the social realities of marriage, annulment and love. But “Kasyamento”, instead of being defines and restricted by the rules of the love story, explores love beyond romantic love and the triangle formulas. The film uses a legal framework (Family Code of the Philippines or Executive Order 209) in conjunction with a reworking and engagement of the romance genre and the conventional expectations this genre cues.
“Kasyamento”, is a brave attempt to feature courtroom drama and love story combined. It discerns the capacity of new breeds to tackle the most important issue in Filipino society. It permits a different view on the courtroom which is often misrepresented in other media. The story of a stenographer and an estranged husband comes as a fresh perspective that exist in the contemporary setting, where the law of marriage and annulment in the Philippines is represented in its most truthful sense.

Much had been said and written about marriage. This thesis project joined the long list of books, fiction and non-fiction, television programs, and motion pictures that had dealt with the subject of love and lifelong commitments. In this short narrative entitled Tuloy?, Lisa, the main character, was confronted with the not-so-romantic face of marriage just moments before her own wedding. The unhappiness that the failed marriages inflicted on the people closest to her, and the possibility that her own marriage might meet the same sad fate caused Lisa to seriously reconsider her decision. In a show of will, Lisa reaffirmed her decision, thereby acknowledging the unknown future.

The concepts for the framework were borrowed from the Social Exchange Theory of John Thibaut and Harold Kelley, from the books about marriage as written by Paul Landis, by Constance L. Shehan and Kenneth C.W. Kammeyer, by Judson T. Landis and Mary G. Landis, and by Maxine Rock to name a few.

The production thesis project has an approximated running time of 13 minutes and was shot in digital video.

Title: transit

Genre: Narrative Format: DV

Length: 26 mins. 55 sec.

transit is a magnified look at a critical phenomenon in a young couple's life, which is a depiction of the archetypal exploring male and the predicament of the female/mother who is left behind, all situated in the present society. It is a story which attempts to show the movement of both characters' viewpoint at that particular occurrence, a 'slice of real life' represented, focusing on the details of their condition as they try to construct a transition in finding a desired identity. It takes on an understated form of drama that shows the separate directions of their lives. Like the contradictions of the traditional and the modern, the romantic and the pragmatic, the male and the female- one sets out to explore and to find inspiration through physical journey, through leaving home, through escape and wandering, while the other is left with her own passage through a sense of purpose and assertiveness, confronting the hard facts of her present condition. This is a story of both of their journeys and their outcome, a crossing point between the images of the two genders found through a reversal of their roles.

The Objective of this work is to find through its structure, new ways of presenting a story in video, an attempt to show movement in different forms. It is a synthesis of modern video technology with the physical attributes of a purely mechanical item such as the typewriter. This sort of marriage between a classical and modern tool for storytelling is used to show another way of presenting a journey, and to present it along with the idea of writing while traveling. The motion of the camera, in the manner a typewriter's platen moves, works as a substitute to the actual physical movement done by the character, and provides us the sense that distance is gained through every strike of its keys.

In another aspect, the video is also an attempt to show two kinds of artistic tendencies typified into the two sexes. The male represents that of the romantic, ideal, and spontaneous who is associated with such traditional tool as a typewriter, while the female represents the pragmatic and the modern, who makes her journey through finding a job in the internet.

My thesis entitled, ""Kadugo"" mirrors my life as a victim in my own home. Through its experimental treatment, this thesis manifests the inner workings of the mind of a young woman in the peak of her adolescent years. As a product of a broken family, I has been suffering the psychological and emotional baggage weighed down by the painful treatment of her family particularly her half sister 
Existing under the shadows of a domineering half sister, the character never wins attention and high regard over her half sister's seemingly perfect disposition despite the fact that she is an academic achiever. Being unhappy and silenced by her half sister's intimidation, she is left to suppress the hurt, anger and hatred thus, motivating her to cease her antagonist's existence only in her thoughts. Unable to express the negative emotions within her, she translates her repressed anger through a journey seeing a lot of fast and chaotic movements and kills her step-sister through the distortion of the perfect Barbie doll, being the embodiment of the step-sister. In the end it is seen that in spite of all the hatred, anger and other mixed emotions the character felt due the differences she has with her half sister, there is still a road leading to forgiveness and acceptance. embodiment of the step-sister.

Ang ""Makina ng Manggagawa ay isang anim (6) na minutong animation na mapapanood sa video. Ito ay tumatalakay sa kalagayan ng mga manggagawa sa kasalukuyang sistemang kapitalismo. Ipinapakita sa pelikulang ito na kung sino ang may-ari ng kasangkapan sa produksyon, bagamat wala siyang partisispasyon, ay siya lamang ang nakikinabang ng mga yamang nalilikha. Siya ang makapangyarihan, ang may kontrol sa lahat ng nasasakupan. Ang ganitong kaayusan ang dahilan ng paghihiwalay ng mga tao sa uri. Mga uri na lagi't laging nagtutunggalian.

Ang itsura ay dalawang (2) dimensyunal. Itim puti at abo ang kulay sa simula. Sa umpisa ay makikita ang close-up ng iba't-ibang bahagi ng isang makina. Makikita rin ang mga bahagi ng katawan ng isang tao. Ang kabuuan ng makina ay nakadikit sa katawan ng manggagawa na nagpapatakbo nito. Ang makina at manggagawa ay tila isang entidad. Hindi malinaw kung saan ang hangganan ng dalawa. Ang makina na ito ay lumilikha ng mga malaking butil ng bigas. Mayroong isang maliit na tubo na naghuhulog ng karampot na tipak ng bigas. Nalalaglag ito sa bibig ng manggagawa at ito ang kanyang ikinabubuhay. Ang makina at manggagawa ay hindi lang iisa. Marami sila na lumilikha ng malalaking butil. Marami sila na nabubuhay sa karampot na tipak. Ang mga butil na nalilikha ay kinakain ng mga mala-ahas na nilalang na galamay ng isang malaki at nakasisindak na halimaw. Mayroon itong matalim na pangil, malaking mata at mahabang dila na ginagamit panghagupit sa mga manggagawa. Masusugatan ng dila ng halimaw ang isang manggagawa sa dibdib at bubulwak ang malapot na pulang dugo, Kakalat ito sa katawan ng manggagawa at tutunawin ang bigkis niya sa makina. Kakalat pa ang pulang dugo sa iba pang manggagawa hanggang sa lahat sila ay nakahiwalay na at hindi na nagtatrabaho. Ang mga kamay nila ay magiging espada na gagamitin sa pagputol sa mga mala-ahas na nilalang at pagpatay sa higanteng halimaw

Simple lang ang mensahe ng pelikula: Sa lipunang kapitalista, pinagsasamantalahan ng kapitalista ang manggagawa sa pamamagitan ng pagkontrol sa kasangkapan sa produksyon. Ang ganitong bulok na kaayusan ay dapat wakasan at ang makakapagsagawa lamang nito ay ang mismong pinagsasamantalahan.

The film is entitled ""Ugoy"" in reference to the ""ugoy ng duyan"" which is when a baby is put inside a crib, resembling a hammock, and is rocked back and forth. The steady rhythm keeps the baby calm and eventually puts it to sleep. In that same sense, the only time people with OCD feel at ease is when they succumb to his or her obsessions that have become their own rhythm and daily routine. The film also tackles the relationship between a mother and a son. Undeniably, mothers play a very important role in child rearing. More often than not, if not always, the most influential figure in a child's life, especially during the formative years, is his mother, probably because of the unique bond formed between them beginning at conception. His mother usually teaches the basic knowledge that a person needs to get through life. The line ""mothers know best surely didn't materialize out of nowhere. This film tries to tap into this relationship but in a different light. While it is a mother's genuine care and love for her child that 'makes' him, ironically, it is also what can 'break' him, as the filmmakers will attempt to show in this film.

Two heads may be better than one in achieving a work but in this short film, it shows that a group is not ideal at all times. However, people do not really understand that. Instead like all group efforts, filming is tedious, strenuous and disagreements are likely to occur. It can hold true even on the mere creative process.

The characters, Ina, Karen and Bryan will show you all the excitement that is involved in making a short film.

""SINO AKO?""

Ang pagkakakilanlan ng tao bilang miyembro ng kanyang lipunan ay hindi agad-agad matatamosa araw ng kanyang kapanganakan, kundi kinakailangan niyang matutunan ito mula sa kanyang karanasang pansarili at pangkapwa. Ito ang tinutukoy nating identity na sumasaklaw sa personal, sosyal, historikal, sikolohikal at pang-ekonomiyang kaganapan ng ating pagkatao. Ang pisikal na batayan at ""function"" ng isang tao ay bahagi lamang ng kaganapang ito, hindi superpisyal lamang sa pagkakaroon ng legal na pangalan, kundi ng isang malalim na kaugnayan sa kaniyang pinaggalingang magulang at sa maternal na lipunan ng tao.

Ang mga magulang ang pangunahing tagapag-ugnay sa identity ng tao, kung kaya't ang isa o parehong pagliban sa pagpapalaki ng supling ay mangangahulugang kawalang kaganapan ng identity. Ang pundasyon ng kanyang pagkatao ay marupok at mistulang walang katuparan sa kanyang lipunan. Kung kaya't pilit na binabalikan at sinusuri ng tao ang kanyang kasaysayan at pinagmulan - sino ang identity ng kanyang mga magulang?

Ang paghahanap sa kanyang identity ang karaniwang pinakamatayog na mithiin ng tao. Sapagkat ang mga bakas ng kanilang identity ay limitado sa nakalipas, ang mga maliliit na patunay ng identity ng kaniyang mga magulang ay magsisilbing tagpi-tagping balabal na susuutin ng supling sa araw-araw. Ito ang katuturan ng kanyang pagkatao.

Double Happiness is a film about a Chinese woman raised in the Philippines, who plans of marrying a Filipino and decides whether to conform or go against the traditional custom of Chinese marriage without losing her being Chinese. It shows the modern approach on how a Chinese engagement is conducted and yet, maintains the traditional elements contained in a typical Chinese engagement. The film emphasizes on the weight of the more important value: either to maintain the traditional endogamous patterns of mate selection and thus aligning oneself with parental desire and a greater probability of marriage success, or to break through cultural barriers in the ultimate demonstration of independence and democratic idealism and have the supposedly exciting experience of marrying someone ""different.""

This film shares the fact that the unity of many Chinese families has been cemented or irrevocably destroyed by the issue of the parents' capacity to veto the selection of their child's spouse. It aims to reach out to the audience specifically those traditional Chinese people that intercultural marriage such as Filipino-Chinese Intermarriage should be considered and accepted as an expected and normal practice of marriage.

The fact remains that a family is the basic social unit of society.

Despite the differences of men and women, the two are still trying to share their lives together. Although misunderstandings keep them apart, they still try to live their lives in harmony. They get into a commitment and get into a series of more complications. Things aren't always easy and magical, yet somehow, love is there to bind the two together.

Past experiences - triumphs or failures - mold a person to what she is now. Belief in something one thought she knew may be changed once she goes through that experience. When one thought love is all about happiness and bliss, later she'll find out that it actually isn't.

This story is a product of what has been lived through. Though the genre gives the impression that it is fictional, it is as a matter of fact, real. This is about a guy running away from his supposed-to-be bride on their wedding day, later for him to realize that indeed he needs her though it's a little too late because the girl doesn't want to get into a commitment either.
Inspired by a number of films, this film is avant-garde.

It is about how some teachers, who are genuinely concerned about the welfare of the students, affect and touch the lives of others. Lastly, it also shows how I was transformed from being a student in class to a student in life.

My pursuit of a diploma and the realization of its value are facilitated by my interactions with my professor and some high school students who are educationally ""less privileged"" than I am.

The thesis of this production is domestic violence and its effects on children especially when they actually witness such events first hand. Domestic Violence can be defined as the excessive physical force that is calculated to inflict damages and injuries at home where the husband uses brute force to hurt the wife physically for any reason. This kind of violence is a great issue that our society is now trying to deal with and because of its delicate nature, it is very difficult to openly discuss in an abnormal situation.

Our story is about a little girl who believes that she has a perfect family until she found out that her happy family is not so happy family and that the father whom she knew and loved was actually a wife beater and that her mother has long been hiding the fact that she is a battered wife.

This story tackles this problem of domestic violence in the light of the child's eyes.

This film entitled ""Boss, Gusto Mong Kape?"" is a 17-minute dark comedy narrative shot in 16mm film. The story would like to tackle frustration, depression, and oppression. The film also tackles issues on the common people and their struggles to achieve their goals and dreams and the factors hindering this. One factor is oppression. When pushed to the limits, they resort to measures they may not be capable of doing but end up doing so because of frustration and depression.

In the film, we see a utility man in his 40's whose very much determined, sometimes obsessed, to fulfill his dream of becoming an actor. Upon learning that his colleagues were given ""breaks"", he is pushed to work harder and to assert himself to the directors of the film they are shooting. He tries to do everything just to get that ""big break"" he has been waiting for ever since. When he was given the chance to come out on screen as extra and thought he already fulfilled this long-time dream and finds out he did not, everything seems to fall apart. This event made him feel very disappointed and frustrated with himself and the people around him, and ends up doing something to get back at the people whom he thought would help him fulfill his dreams. He serves them poisoned coffee.

This film can be described as a personal one in the sense that it deals with the emotions of desolation and self-doubt that have plagued each one of us at some point in our lives.

The character we have chosen is a discontented young man who sees his life through television, giving him a third person perspective. For him, his thoughts, his life (or rather his version of it), his fantasies, and his experiences have become like television programs, which he is both audience and participant. He seems discontented with everything that he's watching and thus changes the channels constantly. The film ends inconclusively leaving him with only a static signal on the TV.

The use of television serves two purposes: as a metaphor for the character's life and as our chance to parody and give tribute to the medium. The character's life is boxed in just like the programs of television. It offers only a two-dimensional picture and gives no depth.
Television, on the other hand, is a medium that has been both severely criticized and worshipped as the icon of this generation. It is our aim that this ambivalent attitude of our society is captured in our film.

The film runs for fourteen minutes and twenty-two seconds

and was shot on mini-DV and finished in video.

Richard and Ramil were born of parents, Aida and Roger,

who are both short in stature. Ramil is 20. He is an undergraduate and now is on the payroll of The Hobbit House in Malate as a bartender. Richard on the other hand, 17, is graduating from high school this academic year from the Araullo High School.

This documentary is the tale of these two brothers. While they recount their understanding of each another, their apparent difference is what is compared in the documentary. Attention, power, and possessions promote jealousy. Such envy may be particularly marked in children who are less than three years apart in age. Children spaced this closely are likely to compete aggressively for their parents' attention for the earliest days of the younger child's life. Ramil is 20 while Richard is 18.

Both Richard and Ramil claim that there is no hint of jealousy between them. But as the filmmaker's immersion progressed, she discovered that there is envy in the relationship
between Richard and Ramil. This is in terms of physical

capabilities, with emphasis on their height.

Two interviews were conducted. Each was carried out separately from the other. The responses were sorted in bits and placed one after the other in the documentary, in a somewhat tabular format, each bit focusing on a specific aspect of their lives. For example, Ramil was asked to describe his brother's ways with girls. This will be followed by an account of Richard's description of Ramil around women as well, which begins with or followed by a commentary of their mother.

A rookie cop killing for the first time.

A salvage victim in his last spasms of pain.

A mother waiting worriedly for her son to come home.

These are the images that create the scenario in ""Binyag"", a 15-minute narrative film about a rookie cop who is dared by his senior companions to do the ""salvaging of a suspected drug pusher.

Set against two contrasting milieus in Filipino society (the traditional Filipino home and the violent setting of the police profession) ""Binyag"" shows two tragedies that simultaneously happen within the story: the devaluing of human life with the practice of ""salvaging"", and the loss of a person's sense of morality as he gets more absorbed in a system that condones brutality and corruption.

The film Donselyo, a narrative shot in DV format and running approximately for 19 minutes, tackles the issue of male virginity. which is often talked about but seldom visualized on screen. It tells the story of Don, who at 21 has remained a virgin despite peer pressures. As the short film unfolds, we learn that he is greatly influenced by his mother who acquires trauma over the death of the boy's father who died of a sexually transmitted disease.

This film helps to understand the situation of virgin males, who rightly or wrongly, are regarded as inferior in a macho-oriented society.

I talked to as many virgin males as I could, mostly 20 years old and above, to find out why they remain in that state. Like Don, most of them have been greatly influenced by the attitudes about sex as formed by both religion and the home. A second popular reason is simply personal choice; there is no need for any societal or institutional pressures, attitude must have originally been influenced by conservative norms prescribed by one's religion.

In this short film, Donselyo, it shows that there are still adult males who are still virgin because they choose to. Don's choice was influenced by the trauma of a parent. His knowledge of the root cause of this trauma started his liberation.

""Hilaw"" is an expressionistic film about a woman fascinated with the wonders of beauty enhancers. It deals with mass media, specifically advertisements, as a social agent that constructs identity. It highlights advertisements as an influential entity of a society in molding an individual self. Ads give information that are absorbed by the viewer's mind. As a result, the viewer unconsciously creates a reality based on the information given by the commercials. She/ He then sees the given information as a social order that should be maintained and followed by the people. Because of its power in manipulating people's mind, it is used by the dominant culture to promote a supreme identity. ""Advertisements, being an instrument of the ruling culture, make an individual alienated from oneself"" is our thesis statement.

With advertisements as our main topic, we use the style of commercial productions as our treatment. The film is a satirical presentation of a person who is addicted with beauty enhancers which makes her alienated from herself. We also intended to adopt the style of infomercials where different styles, visuals, effects, and slogans of the famous beauty product commercials are used to construct our messages. As a result, the film juxtaposes images of television commercials with the main character mimicking these ads

The film starts with a narration about a vain woman named Anjie, a typical mid-20s Filipina woman prepares herself for a party. Anjie uses beauty products that can transform her into a whiter, and thus more beautiful woman. She proceeds to the party with pride. However, in the party, she becomes the center of laughter. People mock her because of her exaggerated, clown-like appearance. Her embarrassment and confusion directs her towards the hall where she meets a woman who discloses to her through a more realistic mirror, how she appears to others. Anjie goes home and dips to her bathtub to relax. Suddenly, bottles of various beauty products fall from all directions drowning her.

Her alter-ego saves Anjie and she finally faces her real and simple identity on the magic mirror which is now turned into a simple mirror of stark reality.",BODY IN FILMS,fil,Expe.,8:28,"Baraquio, Jennalyn S.; Pedido, Erickson T.","Pablo, Eli Joseph; Atos, Martina Antoinette; Cuntapay, Jo-Marie","Velasco, Jovenal D.

""PILAT"" is a short narrative film shot in both digital and mini- DV. It has running time of 8 minutes and 55 seconds. This is based on Lord Villanueva's short story ""I Hope It Doesn't Scar."" The film is about a young man named Seth, 22 years old, who plays the role of both a loving and caring older brother to his younger sister Lee, 8 years old, and a loyal and aggressive brother to his fraternity brothers.

The film's story happens in only one day. On that day, we see the unraveling of another aspect of Seth's personality, from being a tending brother to Lee into a violent and brutal fraternity member.

We chose ""I Hope It Doesn't Scar,"" because for us the story talks an interesting contradiction that may happen in an individual, the capacity for tenderness, as well as for violence. As Seth takes care of Lee, he's tender side is evident. And during the fight we can see how, if influenced by his environment - the fraternity war - Seth can become aggressive. The atmospheric element also attracted us to the short story.

We a of the original story, but we revised some lines and dialogues. We differentiated the scenes where Seth is with Lee with the scenes where he is with his fraternity by using different mise-en-scene

It is innate in every man to be caring, but in time he'll also learn to be violent, either for his own protection or for the persons he care for. With this film we would like to show the reality of human having both tender side and aggressive side.

The thesis of this production is domestic violence and its effects on children especially when they actually witness such events first hand. Domestic Violence can be defined as the excessive physical force that is calculated to inflict damages and injuries at home where the husband uses brute force to hurt the wife physically for any reason. This kind of violence is a great issue that our society is now trying to deal with and because of its delicate nature, it is very difficult to openly discuss in an abnormal situation.

Our story is about a little girl who believes that she has a perfect family until she found out that her happy family is not so happy family and that the father whom she knew and loved was actually a wife beater and that her mother has long been hiding the fact that she is a battered wife.

This story tackles this problem of domestic violence in the light of the child's eyes. The child lives a life that revolves around her family, school, church and friends and there is always an adverse effect for children who are victims of such situations in the social structure.

In Japan, the term anime refers to all types of animation, whether it is a Disney movie imported from America or original Japanese animation. May stories depicted in anime are taken from popular Japanese manga series.
Manga, which can be loosely translated as “whimsical sketches”, refers to the Japanese black white comics that constitute 40% of Japan’s publishing industry.
Here in the Philippines, anime has been steadily growing in popularity since the 1970’s when Voltes V and other “super robot” series were first shown locally. In the last few years, anime enthusiast has formed clubs in several colleges and high schools. Anime conventions have been also held yearly since the year 2000, and a number of entrepreneurs have put up various anime-related publications.
The main objectives of this documentary is to show how local fans adapt and integrate what they learn from anime into their daily lives. It introduces the Pinoy “cosplayer,” a participation in an event known as “cosplay”, the shortened form of the phrase “costume play” which was coined in Japan. It also features Filipino inspired by their interest in anime to engage in the Japanese martial art known as kendo. Finally, this documentary presents two Philippine publication: an anime features magazine and a comic book that uses the manga style to tell stories set in the Philippines, and written in Filipino.","CULTURE AND THE CINEMA, ART AND THE CINEMA, SOCIETY IN FILMS",fil,Doc.,18min,Ong Johann Louie,(not included in credits),"Lejano, Eduardo",2003,"Manila, Philippines",14.65677,121.0672,UPFI Student Thesis AV Collection,UPFI000150,Image;MovingImage,image/jpeg,2024-01-04 (Created),2003_AnimeinthePinoyAnima.m4v,Educational use only,https://mainlib.upd.edu.ph/university-archives/revised-policy-on-access-to-theses-and-dissertations-2017/

It may seem as easy as hopping and stepping forward, but the game piko has its own set of rather intricate mechanics. In the narrative, the game is used as an outline and metaphor of building a relationship with another person.
The story revolves around Yna, a struggling young documentary filmmaker who tries to find her place and identity as she juggles work and relationship. Inevitably, she finds herself in a crossroad when her long- time boyfriend and live-in partner makes a proposal. She is torn between her relationship with Pipo and the promise of making a name for herself.
Simultaneously, she is working on a project about the game piko wherein she eventually finds the answer a panacea in the form of a young girl's simplistic words reminiscent of childhood wisdom.
The game piko is a very important element in this narrative. It is used as a sketch of the situation of Yna's relationship with her boyfriend. The mechanics of the game is seen as a parallelism of the efforts and the attempts to keep a relationship and actually making it last.
This film deals with women in the workplace, their role in a traditional and patriarchal society, and the sacrifices and compromises they make.",HUMAN RELATIONS IN FILM,fil,Nar.,10:11,"Gonzales, Ana Maria Cristina B.","Abesamis, Edsel; Gonzales, Ana","Lejano, Eduardo",2003,"Manila, Philippines",14.65677,121.0672,UPFI Student Thesis AV Collection,UPFI000151,Image;MovingImage,image/jpeg,2024-01-04 (Created),2003_ElInfernaculo.m4v,Educational use only,https://mainlib.upd.edu.ph/university-archives/revised-policy-on-access-to-theses-and-dissertations-2017/

This documentary is about the filmmaker's one-year experience in Japan as an exchange student. This trip was prompted by a desire to escape from the feeling of emptiness and boredom and gain a measure of independence from protective parents.
The documentary starts from shots of downtown Tokyo and from there, moves to shots of familiar people. The documentary shows how a foreign student could cope with life in the foreign country, and that is by forming social ties. The three people who made the greatest impact on the filmmaker's life in Japan were given focus.
Because the year passed by quickly than the filmmaker expected, the documentary has an overall fast pace. In the end of the filmmaker's stay there, and also in the documentary, she felt/said that when she finally learned to cope with life in Japan, she had to go back to her country which at that moment, became foreign to her.

A competition doesn’t end in winning. Behind the glitter… behind the color.. behind there is still life. And it is not always as beautiful as a prize trophy.
Luchi is an excellent dancer. He knows it feels to win. In spite of this, he still feels the emptiness in his life- the respect, love and acceptance of his family and of people around him. 
Will winning ever be enough? A question that he asks himself every time he moves to the rhythm of each dance. This question he also asks every time he thinks about taking his own life in spite of the glory he has. Will I ever be enough?
Our quest for the answer to this question is never-ending. Our lives are often always haunted by our fear of being inadequate, of being not good enough despite of the things that we have. This fear is the reason why most, if not all of us, strive to be good—to be great. But when do you say it’s enough? Who can say if you are enough? Ultimately, we can either find the answer to these questions or spend our entire lives still asking it. 
It was just another night of ballroom during competition... a lot of thoughts haunt Luchi’s mind… 
He is a good dance. Trophies can easily prove that. But why can’t it fill the emptiness that he feels? Will he go on and fight one more time or just stop an admit his defeat…. 
The film shall start with the image of Luchi’s routine-like suicide. Then the seductive chachacha shall begin. Image of Luchi’s dance and life will be alternated to be able to show the contrast of the two and all at the end ask if he really had the victory.
Throughout the film, Luchi will be heard describing each dance. Words that does not only let us feel the rhythm of each music and the grace of each dance but also the violence and loneliness of his life.","DANCE IN FILMS, HUMAN RELATIONS IN FILM",fil,Nar.,14min,"Icban, Kristine Mariel Castillo; Raymundo, Carmi Garcia ","Icban, Cris J.

Every human being, regardless of his or her social in life is captivated by the alluring impression of power. People aspire for power in order to satisfy their personal desires and concerns. Power performs to face reckon with, which propels of any age, sex, and social status to exploit all of their resources to acquire it, even up to the point of endangering the morality of their intention. 
The film illustrates how the inevitable effects of political ambitions affected the young life of two high school students as they both vie for the same position in the student council. It will focus on that activities done by the respective parties of two candidates before the election proper.
The campaign propaganda used by one of the major characters will depict how the need for power propels a person to have a deep need for prestige, personal admiration and the need to exploit others. The play of lights and colors together with costumes and image presentation of characters are one of the mediums that will be used in the film in showing the conflict between the two major characters who are both driven by political pursuits, although displaying totally distinct means to have this dream to be realized. 
Through Laro, the filmmaker conveys how the neurotic needs of a person, for example the need for power, affect his/her principles and morality. The political issue in the film represents the reality behind politics issue in the film represents the reality behind politics in micro level in reference to the greater, more general aspect of politics/power in the country.

What if runs in circles? Events that are happening now happened a million times before.
Patibong is a five-minute experimental film that show the agony of a man trapped in a dreadful moment made even worse because of his memory loss. He helplessly goes through the same terrible repetitive ordeal, unable to escape the circular timeframe where everything is happening over and over, precisely and endlessly- but for him, always for the very first time.   
The short film is shot in 35mm at Mowelfund Film Institute and features the acting talents of Joel Torre and Jhon Arcilla. Its concept is greatly influenced by a recurring dream experience of the filmmaker concerning circular time and being trapped in it. There is no clear beginning (past) nor end (future) to the circle-only the “now” (present) is what we are capable of remembering. Memory becomes irrelevant and to the extreme-a non-existing concept.

This documentary is about the filmmaker's one year experience in Japan as an exchange student. This trip was prompted by a desire to escape from the feeling of emptiness and boredom and gain a measure of independence from protective parents.

The documentary starts from shots of downtown Tokyo and from there, moves to shots of familiar people. The documentary shows how a foreign student could cope with life in the foreign country, and that is by forming social ties. The three people who made the greatest impact on the filmmaker's life in Japan were given focus.

Because the year passed by quickly than the filmmaker expected, the documentary has an overall fast pace. In the end of the filmmaker's stay there, and also in the documentary, she felt/said that when she finally learned to cope with life in Japan, she had to go back to her country which at that moment, became foreign to her. So she would have to go under another cycle of familiarization and adjustment.",,fil,Nar.,15:26,"Enorme, Maylee Bania","Meñez, Paul Frias; Mendoza, Paula Tricia; Ocampo, Francis; Balce, Eli","Lejano, Eduardo",2003,"Manila, Philippines",14.65677,121.0672,UPFI Student Thesis AV Collection,UPFI000161,Image;MovingImage,image/jpeg,2024-01-05 (Created),2003_Payagwan.m4v,Educational use only,https://mainlib.upd.edu.ph/university-archives/revised-policy-on-access-to-theses-and-dissertations-2017/

Originally Awit Ni Orpeyos was titled ""Sodade."" The initial proposal was to make an adaptation of Francisco Arcellana's short story titled ""Yellow Shawl."" The script of Awit Ni Orpeyos had gone through countless rewrites, and what was originally an adaptation concept evolved to a more personal work tackling depression caused by the lost of a loved one. What is now the final concept of Awit Ni Orpeyos was written during a time when I myself was dealing with depression. The script of Awit Ni Orpeyos took a year to write, owing to the countless time I had to walk away from the project. It is not clear if I was depressed or writing the script may have caused my depression, but it does give credence to the phrase that life does imitate art; or maybe art does initiate life. 

Background 
Awit Ni Orpeyos is a film based on the story of Orpheus. Awit Ni Orpeyos translated to English means The Song of Orpheus Orpheus was the son of the god Apollo in Greek mythology. Orpheus was a musician, the songs he sang and the music he played on his lyre enchanted gods, mortals, and beast alike. Orpheus fell in love and married a beautiful nymph named Eurydice, but on their wedding day she was bitten by a poisonous snake, and died. Stricken with grief, Orpheus makes a journey to the Underworld to bring back his wife. He sang and played his lyre with such sorrow that they say even Sisyphus sat idle on his rock to listen. Moved by his grief, Hades and Persephone grants Orpheus to take her with him on one condition, that he must not look back at Eurydice until they were both completely out of the Underworld. Eurydice followed behind him in silence. As they came upon the way out, Orpheus to reassure himself that she was still following, glanced back. Eurydice sank back into the darkness. Orpheus returned to the living, where his music became even more melancholy, reflecting his suffering over the loss of Eurydice. Enraged by Orpheus' refusal to love of other women, the Thracian maidens tore his body to pieces and tossed his head and lyre into the river. At last, Orpheus was reunited with his love, Eurydice.

Champoy is about the ever-helpful mailman Elias, who believes that life is much like the taste of Champoy- sweet, which turns sour, then turns sweet again. Whatever happens, there will always be a happy ending, just like the way comic books end. That is why when he was rejected when he tried to court Sarah, he refused to accept everything. He firmly believed that he eventually will be with Sarah, much like the comics he is fond of reading.
It is only he was rejected the second time around does he realize that he must move on. Or does he?
This digital motion picture on a deeper level is about one of the most basic trait of human soul- hope. Whereas hope is a positive thing and is always reinforced in literature and in film, Champoy attempts to give another perspective on this and show that hope so as to differentiate it from were wishful thinking 
Champoy is shot on digital video format and is 18-minutes long.

This project is a short glimpse on life, death, and an artist trying to tell his story through his comicbook drawings. The story revolves around him, a suicidal character, and trails off to someone else, a wandering girl, following her to the fringes of time- the duration of life, until their paths cross. “Magkikita kaming muli…”
This project is in 16mm color film format and runs for about 14 minutes taking the viewer from one character to the other. In the end, both characters wind up in the same scene and the movie settles with an anticlimactic resolution to the artist’s dilemma – suicide. The girl tells the artist that his life is not his to take, this she does in a very compendious manner. Thereafter, the artist learns to take life is an it is knowing that one day, his time will come, like everybody else’s “….magkikita tayong muli.”
Crux Ansata is another term for the ankh-a cross with a loop for its head. It has long been use (mostly commonly by the Egyptians as in Cleopatra’s needle) a symbol of life and its totality as it reaches it culmination-death

Dog have always been considered “man’s best friend”. They have been a major part of the lives of human beings since time immemorial. They have served as pets, hunting companions and protectors in different countries all over the world. In the Philippines, dogs are regarded in many different ways and are generally considered as house pets or guard dogs. Being a dog lover, the filmmaker found it fascinating to take an in-depth look at the lives of this type of animal.

The story will start on sequences showing how her yaya and playmates neglect Anna, which makes her to feel that nobody is there for her. Until one day when a man named Lolo Isko catches Anna’s attention this makes the girl to feel that this man has his own inner strengths that he can’t show for some reasons. As the story goes, Anna has captured Lolo Isko’s heart and this becomes the start of their “wholeness” as an individual again. The fact that for both of them, one has finally recognized their existence changes the way they look at life which in turn will have an effect in their character development as an individual.

Anna’s rejection and her feelings of always being left alone are common to kids. Lolo Isko living by himself alone is not that new with our elders. But the meeting of the 2 characters will help each other to free their negative attitudes towards life. Those things lacking at Anna’s life will be filed by Lolo Isko’s presence and vice-versa.

My documentary film, Cheese Curls, hope to show my personal encounter with a lifelong, development speech disorder called autism through my one and only 19-year-old sister Cheers. It seeks to show how a disability such autism can affect (whether directly or indirectly) the lives of those who are meant to live, cope and adjust to it.
Over the years, efforts have been made- in print or film/video- to autism to affected parents and families. A lot has been written and shown about the autistic child and his/her supposed ‘glass world’. Such studies have helped demystify myths concerning autism by somehow ‘unmasking’ the autistic child. But in spite of all these efforts to provide awareness among concerned families, little is mentioned about what the family may really feel or suffer. The role of the normal siblings is also seldom discussed. Although their situations do not appear to be as difficult or as problematic as those who actually suffer from it, I believe, based on my experience, that the role of the normal sibling is also worth focusing on. Communication among normal siblings is important. If they are taken more seriously and allowed to voice out their concerns, the risk of developing further confusion, fear, and anxiety among them may be reduced.
Cheese Curls doesn’t mean to exploit or romanticize persons or situation. It only intends to reach out to those who happen to be in the same situation as I am by representing a normal day-to-day interaction between a normal 20-year old sister and her autistic 9- year old sibling. It also hopes to show how my sister’s condition continually shape the person that I am today and the person I may become in the future.",HUMAN RELATIONS IN FILM,fil,Doc.,15:37,"San Jose, Djoanna Sarino","San Jose, Ramon; San Jose, Soledad; Campilan, Lornadahl Nielo

panata People have been long familiar with a certain kind of religious practice commonly known as ""penitensya"". Many Filipinos have been continuing this tradition and every year, the event is shown on television. Often, what the media shows presents only a spectacle. The public is shown with weird people who inflict pain on themselves as part of the annual celebration of Lent. There is very little presentation of the realities behind this unusual tradition. The penitents and their motivations are also rarely understood.
 In this documentary video entitled Panata there is a desire to be more deeply acquainted with this tradition and with those who practice it. This documentary seeks to divert from the shallow perspective that is often projected by the media. The objective of this documentary is to present the tradition from within and to get an inner and deeper perspective. It intends to find out the truth behind this unique practice of religious penitence by knowing the penitents more personally as well as the realities of their lives in relation to their practice. 
The events presented in this documentary revolve around the life of one penitent who lives in a town that has a very long history of practicing religious penitence through self-flagellation and crucifixion every Holy Week. From his life and own experience, this documentary will show an inside view of this religious practice. Things that are not
 usually presented in the yearly news and features on television will be shown here. The filmmaker believes that this religious penitence is not a simple Filipino tradition or cultural practice. It involves personal motivations that stem from teachings that formed the ideologies of the people practicing it. This documentary hopes that through the life of one penitent, the audience will be able to have a better knowledge and clearer understanding of the realities and truth that generally prevails among all those who practice this unique Filipino tradition.

Genre:

Format:

Video

Running Time:

22 minutes

The sarswela as an art form has attracted many a great mind into writing of its inception and decline, but the lives of the people who produced, starred and otherwise labored on it remain largely undocumented. This video aims to fill the gap by focusing on the main players of the sarswela.

Central to this visualization is the objective of knowing and depicting the lives of the sarswela players themselves who will give us more than a passing glimpse of the prevailing socioeconomic conditions during sarswela's heyday.

Admittedly, tracking down sarswela players who are still alive and lucid was one of our biggest challenges, but we were finally able to locate three members of ""Samahang Pag-asa"" in Meycauayan, Bulacan, these are 72-year old Luningning and Benjamin Conquilla and 76-year old Reynaldo delos Santos. Therefore, through this documentary, we would like to give credit to these people for their contributions to sarswela and to visualize clues to their character and personality in the larger context of the sarswela. We have attempted to humanize the topic by actually going to three people who have been directly involved in the history of sarswela

Using the style and techniques of the classical documentary, we utilized archive materials, stills, original sarswela scripts and even renditions of original sarswela songs, complemented by a narrative voice- over. Our target audiences can be grouped into theater enthusiasts, the sarswela-goers of old, and the film-oriented young people who are interested in the historical roots of contemporary Philippine cinema.

Ang bawat takbo ng buhay ng tao ay may kanya-kanyang ritmong sinusundan tungo sa kanyang ganap na kabuuhan at kasiyahan. Sa pagtibok ng puso, sa mga plano sa buhay, sa pagkamit ng isang pangarap. Minsan ito'y bumibilis, minsan bumabagal, minsa'y hindi masundan Ngunit sa mga kasiyahan, kalungkutan at kaguluhan na naranasan ng bawat tao, ang kanyang tunay na nararamdaman at ikasasaya ang siyang magbibigay ng ganap na ritmo sa kani-kaniyang buhay.
Sa isang magulong klasrum makikitang sumasasayaw mag-isa ang isang payat at maitim na 12 taong gulang na batang lalaki, taimtim sa pag- eensayo. Sa pagkakaroon ng isang dula sa eskwela, tinitignan ito ni Julio bilang isang pagkakataong mailabas ang kanyang matinding hilig sa pananayaw. Ngunit sa pangungutya ng kanyang mga kaklase, pagkabagsak niya sa akademiko, ang pag-aaway ng kanyang magulang na dinaratnan niya sa bahay, nahihirapan ngunit tahimik lang si Juliong tumuloy sa kanyang kasiyahan. Ang kanyang pagdadalaw sa kanyang bulag na lola, bukod pa sa kanyang sayaw, ay ang siyang nagdudulot ng katihimikan sa kanyang damdamin. Sasayawan niya ang kanyang lola,makikipagkwentuhan sa mga mahal sa buhay at magsasaya sa tahimik na pagsasama Ngunit sa pagka-atake at tuluyang pagkamatay ng kanyang lola, gagamitin ni Julio ang alaalang minsa'y nagkasama silang parehong nararamdaman ang matinding pagmamahal at kagalakan, at dadalhin niya ito habang buhay sa pagkamit ng kanyang mga pangarap.
Ang ritmo sa pelikulang ito ay ginamit pareho sa kontento at porma. Ang sayaw, bilang isang matagal na hilig at malapit sa puso ng direktor, ay siyang ginamit na motif sa pag-ukol sa ritmo, na haligi ng sining pangtanghalang ito. Halos lahat ng mga kuha ng kamera at pati sa post produksyon ay gumagalaw, na nais maipakita na pati ang pelikula ay sumasayaw. Gumamit din ng ""live sound"" upang mas tunay ang pagkaganap ng mga eksena at mas makibahagi sa manonood. May mga eksenang inuulit, binabagalan o binibilisan, at pati sa musika tinukoy ang pagkapurong ""percussion,"" bilang isang ganap na grupo ng mga ritmikong instrumento, at pagkatunog na Filipino, bilang repleksyon sa kultura at pamamaraan ng pamumuhay ng mga karakter sa lipunan.
Sa pag-aaral na ito, nais maipakita ang kahalagahan ng pagsunod sa sariling isipan at damdamin sa lahat ng bagay. Sa wikang Ingles, ang ibig sabihin nito ay ""follow your heart."" Dito mo lamang tunay na mapapaligaya ang sarili. Ngunit dapat ding isipin ang mga pangyayaring maaaring idulot nito. At higit sa lahat kung kaya mong harapin at tanggapin ito. Ang pagsunod sa ating mga puso ay ang ating motibasyon upang mabuhay. Mahirap hanapin ito ngunit kailangang dumaan sa hirap upang maramdaman ang tunay na ligaya
Ngunit mas higit pa rito, nais ring maipakita ang kahalagahan ng mga biswal upang maipahiwatig ang aking mensahe. Naniniwala akong hindi lang naipapakita ang isang mahalagang aralin sa pamamagitan ng salita. Karamihan sa mga dialogues ko ay ""1-liner"" lamang. Gaya nga ng sinasabi ngayon, ""less is more."" At ang ""anyo"" ng ritmo sa mga kilos ng mga tao at bagay ay makikita sa buong pelikula. Dito lalabas ang kahalagahan ng balanse ng form & content sa pelikula, na kahit karamihan ay biswal, kitang-kita naman ang mensahe.

It is a sharing of a life experience of a lesbian who dares to tell her history (herstory for that matter) different from what most people think. Most of the time, lesbians are dismissed for being men-haters, suffering from penis-envy, or a traumatic experience. limang minuto sa langit tries to tell otherwise. Rather being a lesbian is just a matter of sexual awakening and it's a choice, and it's just fine.

 ”NASA SA’YO”  is a short narrative film shot in mini-DV. It runs for 16-minutes and 24-seconds. The film is short about how two forms of popular culture, fortunetelling and entertainment journalism, construct “realities”.
The story revolves around Lan, an entertainment columnist. He writes a controversial article questioning a popular actor’s sexuality, and gives rise to all his troubles. Confused, he resorts to fortunetelling, particularly card reading and believing completely what the cards say. The complicates even more his problem.
The film tries to show the certain of reality in fortunetelling. People tend to lap up predictions from fortunetellers and card predictions and take them as truths. Because of this belief, people make crucial decision in life based on what is told in productions.
Parallel to card predictions, media also creates reality. Showbiz gossip constructs the identities of pop culture celebrities which in turn the public as uncritical media consumers take as reality itself. For a parodic tone and at the same time show the influences of the gay subculture in local showbiz, a campy style and treatment are employed.",GENDER AND THE CINEMA,fil,Nar.,16:07,"Bacaltos, Blanca Angela; Nunag, Xavier Yasay ","Cruz, Jeffrey; Nunag, Lucas; Bacaltos, Armand","Velasco, Jovenal D.

“Isaw ng Bayan” is a postmodern comedy that revolves around Marian, a 17-year-old girl who is born to a conventional upper-middle class family. She is used to being pampered by her protective presents, as well as her yaya and driver. One day, she wakes up with nobody else at home and makes her way to school all by herself. She crosses paths with Mang Jerry, a middle-aged street vendor who lives a life that is in absolute contrast with hers. Through isaw, one of the street foods that Mang Jerry sells, Marian liberates herself from the stiffing sheltered life she has always led, and becomes a part of the “real world” she has never known before.
The story aims to challenge the common conception that people must always look for security in life. By security, we mean particularly the capacity to provide for a protected living. One is secure in life when she has satisfied her basic needs- shelter, food, clothing, belongingness, etc.- and has remained inside the protected area she has allotted for herself. But sometimes, this security makes the person ignorant, dependent and weak. In the story, Marian becomes ignorant because she doesn’t know the real world, a world totally different from her own; dependent because she is not used to being alone and doing things alone; weak because she easily loses faith in times of crisis, something which is also new to her.
The story is partly autobiographical. We find ourselves in the character of Marian, being both products of protective parents and of exclusive high schools. We feel sort of “sheltered” ourselves, something which we are not the rule is survival of the fittest.
Humanity does not only include joys, laughter, and glory. The true meaning of existence is also found in pain, hardship, and suffering. Marian, as well as we, having been always “protected”, have known little of these things. In order to introduce her to the real world, we used a street food called isaw as a representation of this reality. The audience can easily food caters to all kinds of people- the rich, the poor, students, workers, kids, and mostly everyone. It symbolizes all the things Marian was not exposed to. We chose the University of the Philippines setting, because we also want to allude to the kind of education the school offers, as represented by the statue of the Oblation. Street foods are very common in UP. And just like isaw, UP caters to needs of students from different economic sectors. Thus, when Marian finally reaches for isaw and eats it, she become a whole new person. She becomes more human.

In the darkness of a room, an unkempt and despairing writer raises a toast to his latest rejection letter. 
“Para sayo, Benedict Gonzalo… isang magaling na writer!” 
Once again, he toments himself by reading the letter before crumpling it up ang tossing it into a corner. Then he picks up his manuscript and commences to burn it page by page. 
Footsteps are heard. His wife Ling appears and snatches the burning page from him. She demands to show why he was burning his manuscript. 
Benedict explains that he had always wanted to be writer. With all the rejections piled one up to other though, he had reached the end of his tether and had decided to give up. 
When Ling attempts to encourage him, Benedict hands her some of his works so that she could read through her failures. 
Ling points out that the reason for his unhappiness was probably because he did not write with an original mind but instead wrote what he thought others would want to read.
Infuriated, Benedict accuses Ling of being unsympathetic. He tells her that she would never understand how much stories mean t him because creating stories had always come easily for her.
Ling suggest that perhaps he was afraid to put his own voice into writing because his abusive mother had always discouraged him from writing. 
Benedict declares that it all didn’t matter since he was going to stop writing anyway. 
Ling accuses him of being a liar and coward. She declares that for her, making stories had never been a game. Her stories had always come from deep inside, so that she could touch children like the child he had been.  Benedict promises to write his own story-a real and honest story. After giving him some final words of encouragement, Ling leaves.
His mother arrives and tells Benedict to leave the room. She scolds him for writing again.
With Ling’s presence still fresh in his mind, Benedict was finally able to defy his mother. She leaves him by himself in the darkness of his room.
Alone in the light of a single desk lamp, Benedict begins to write.

This documentary is about Allan Padua, also known a Mura, who is the midget host of the noontime show Masayang Tanghali Bayan(MTB). Mura is 29 years old from Guinobatan, Albay. He started as a circue performer in Ermita, Manila until he was discovered as a twin partner for Mahal, another midget host in show. He is asked to dress and act as a female for the tandem. Our perya culture of jesters, jugglers and freak shows made it easy for the Filipino audience to accept and enjoy this kind of entertainment. It immediately increased ratings for the show and is now continually being craved by the market.
Allan’s job is stressful for his condition and the psychological and social consequences may be greater. He is the object of Filipino rough humor for his physical deformities and not for his humor. He is the source of laughter, amusement and ridicule. Indeed, Allan is just one of the many talents in television who is exploited.
It is true that Mura provides for a poor family and that he enjoys what he is asked to do. But all these presenting of himself is a whole different ballgame. Lack economic freedom has already been used as a melodramatic excuse and reason for attacking the ruthless acting business.
He may be adult enough to follow his own will but his choices are influenced and even dictated by the dominant power. He is asked to play a child, a clown, an underdog, the butt of jokes and he is even used as a prop for comedy shows. It is indeed a profession because he earns well. He sacrifices his sexuality and condition only to lose credibility and respect. This situation unfortunately lets him believe that there is no abuse and that dwarfsploitation is just guni-guni.
MTB is associated with TV carnival. Its games, contests, production numbers and host carry the katuwaan to the television sets. But as MTB continues to argue that Allan is treated fairly and that the program produces and distributes norms and ideas of the public, it is still ineffectual. The audience is blinded to accept everything “as the way things are” as opposed to “what it ought to be” Exploitation has never been this easy and cheap. As TV programs are turning into a multibillion peso moro-moro, the dominant ideology of the powerful creates false consciousness. The spirit of un katuwaan must now be taken seriously in order to create a truly free and liberating Philippine TV both for the actors and the audience.

Stress is an unavoidable consequence in life. It represents any environmental event or the covert perception of an environmental event signaling to the individual that some undesirable consequence will occur. It is the little everyday things that one worries about and the troubles we tend to complicate even if they are just products of paranoia. If these unwanted negative thoughts enter consciousness, they may cause considerable personal distress. These unwanted thoughts can create doubts about one's self-worth; raise concerns about the past, present and future; and lower confidence about one's ability to overcome problems and to make sense of difficult life experiences.

Just as distress can cause disease, it seems plausible that there are good stresses that promote wellness. Stress is not always necessarily harmful. Winning a race or election can be just as stressful as losing, or more so, but may trigger very different responses. The level of stress differs for each of us.",,fil,Expe.,3:20,"Cruz, Denise","Rosario, Lai; Cruz, Jeff; Naguit, Nani","De Guzman, Anne Marie G.

From the olden times to the present many things have changed. The landscape had been dramatically modified from what it was ten years ago. For one, the technology has grown exponentially the past few years evidenced by technological and scientific developments. For instance, almost every week a new model of cellular phone is launched in the market. Another example is that if you have been to a locale years ago, you may find it difficult to retrace your steps because the infrastructure may be different from the last time you have been there. But, if there is one thing all these changes failed to influence, is our society. In fact, society has used these innovations to its advantage.
One aspect of society that has never changed is how it perceives the ideal. For instance, an ideal student is one who gets high grades, an ideal son is one who always obeys his parents, and an ideal friend is always there for you. This aspect of society creates an invisible force or a hegemony that creates pressure on people. They tend to follow the ideal so much that sometimes they find themselves not knowing who they are anymore.

They all desired change. They believe that what changes comes progress. They disliked the rules for their narrow-mindness, believing that they lack understanding of what the people need and thought of themselves most of the time. They believed the government must be cleansed of its feeble minded rulers. That in order for the colony to reach a state of equilibrium, the ruler must be replaced.
The mas of cockroaches plunged into the streets and expressed their disgusts and demands from their ruler. Their efforts were rewarded well for they succeeded in ousting their ruler. A new ruler was put into office. Peace was restored but only for a while. Their actions will have a recurring effort on the masses’ socio-political behavior.

On a hot summer day, the air so humid you could almost drown in it, sixteen-year-old Peachy Angeles decides to jump off the high school rooftop. Thus begins Sugur, a dark but poignant coming-of-age story about the relationship between two high school students - Peachy and Wacks. After being dumped by the most popular girl in school, Wacks and his friends bet on Peachy, the school's social outcast, to restore Wacks"" bruised ego. But as the relationship between the two grows deeper, Wacks discovers things about Peachy that makes him understand the reasons for her unhappiness and why she wouldn't let other people get close to her. Winning Peachy's trust, the two start dating. Peachy eventually discovers that she is only the object of a bet between Joaquin and his friends. Heartbroken, Peachy ends the relationship. Joaquin realizes that he has truly fallen in love. What started as a bet between a group of friends ended up changing both lives forever? Aside from paying homage to teen movies and shows, particularly
TGIS and Growing Up, that greatly influenced the filmmaker while growing up, the film tackles the serious issue of self-cutting or ""Deliberate Self-Harm Syndrome"" - a phenomena especially prevalent among young adolescent females and suffered by the film's main character Peachy. Those who suffer from this condition deliberately inflict injury upon themselves, ranging from small cuts to hitting objects on themselves or even breaking their own bones, as a way of coping from intense emotions struggling within the person that she is having a hard time expressing. Through cutting, the person feels that she is liberating herself
Self-cutters usually start at the age of 10-16 and a majority of those who suffer are between the ages of 13-30. Some of the reasons that trigger teens to hurt themselves are: there have been a major change in the teen's life such a parent's death or divorce, the teen suffers from sexual abuse or physical violence, the teen is experiencing feelings of fear, hurt, anger, rejection or abandonment. The sufferer usually desperately needs to exert some control over the situation which she could only find through cutting herself. Many psychologists state that cutting is addictive and like drugs, self-injurers will need to make more and deeper cuts as time goes on which could eventually result to grave medical complications.

Happy Birthday Fiji, is about the author’s generation--- a generation that is bombarded by a stereotyped culture of beauty, body, and human relationships. Fiji, the main character, is a victim and has developed social anxiety because she cannot live up to the standards of that culture. She is obsessed with wanting to become the “ideal girl” who is slim, tall, and pretty, but she knows she can never be that. Fiji also loves birthday. She likes taking picture of her birthdays to remind her of that one day in a year when people remember her. She likes spending this occasion with her friends: Leila, Marco, Paul, and of course, Caloi, the love of her life. Everything comes crashing down when, on her 25th birthday, she finds out that Leila is having an affair with Caloi; worse, that none of her friends remembered her birthday. Her self-focused attention has trapped her in her own myopic world. Social anxiety is a problem, but if only Fiji had realized the more pressing ones in her world, she would not have been son assailed and disappointed. This film is critique of people like Fiji. If we focus too much on ourselves, we fail to see the bigger things in life and our place in it. Some of the technique used that best illustrate Fiji’s self-focused attention are split screen from Fiji’s camera’s point of view.

""Suppose time is a circle, bending back on itself. The world repeats itself precisely, endlessly. For the most part, people do not know they will live their lives over.""

-Einstein's Dreams

Time is a circle when memories unknowingly passed on become events lived

In this day and age, we see ourselves as individuals, our lives as uniquely created by our own will. The advances in technology and philosophy have given us more choices than we can ever choose. What to do, where to go, what to use, and who to become-all are options of how to live our lives, and why. We are the captains of our ships and our journey is entirely up to us.

This individualism has dulled our sense of society, of personal history. We then become victims of the very lives we lead, which have been lived before us, because history keeps repeating its jokes on us. Until we get the joke, it will not stop. Until we take the effort to look back and ask the question why we are who we are and who the people are who got us here, then we will remain trapped in a cycle of historical ignorance. Trapped because of ignorance, trapped in ignorance. Then, lives are repeated endlessly.",MUSICIANS IN FILMS,fil,Nar.,18:20,"Monzon, Anne Cecilia","Monzon, Edwin; Monzon, Lulu; Bautista, Danroel; Barcelona, Franz","Tiongson, Nicanor",2004,"Manila, Philippines",14.65677,121.0672,UPFI Student Thesis AV Collection,UPFI000202,Image;MovingImage,image/jpeg,2024-01-05 (Created),2004_CuatroManos.m4v,Educational use only,https://mainlib.upd.edu.ph/university-archives/revised-policy-on-access-to-theses-and-dissertations-2017/

Cars are one of the most basic transportations we have. It’s one convenient way of travelling from one place to another. Having your own car means being able to control your travel time and being free to privately do things that you want. For others, this mode of transportation is must-have in their lives because it does provide its rider’s comfort and convenience especially if used in a busy city like Manila. But for others, it’s so much more than that. The brightly colored paints splattered across the body, the angry mufflers one hears from a speeding auto and low-rider vehicles speak so much of the obsession and fascination of the owners of the vehicles. One can instantly and easily say that the owner is really into cars.
But still to other car lovers, the obsession goes beyond all the dressing up and beautification of the car. The real deal is all in the engine because once the race is on, there’s no stopping all the stronger, swifter, and faster cars in town. And people who want to prove their car’s masculinity engage in the very popular, but illegal world of drag racing.
There’s something about going fast that is intensely alluring. And while it is cool to be fast, it’s even better to be fastest. If you can say you’re the fastest, you earn a whole new level of respect. This is the very concept of drag racing.

Si Nelson, ang Litrato, at ang Bruha is an eight-minute experimental filmograph about the untold truth about childhood. The film is a critique, an essay telling us that childhood is all fun. Behind the smiles, laughter and the playful spirit, children do face problems that may take great effect later on as they grow up. 
Admit it or not, we remember hidden emotions, connect unspoken stories and feel that there was something amiss when we look back at our own childhood. A realization magnified most especially when we look at family photographs. 
The film will try to convey this manner of looking back by presenting a series of family photographs that will make up the video of the film. While the video of the film evokes a wholesome mood, the audio will be that of the story of a specific child, Nelson, who will represent childhood. It is about a boy who desperately wants to go outside and play and have fun but is always prevented and reprimanded by his mother.

""A tribe scattered and hungry becomes weak to care for its own culture."" Lawrence Ong. Bridge-Builder in Our Midst, 2001
 ""Pamumuay"" (Bee Hunt) is a 15-minute documentary that tells the story of the struggle of an Ayta family of the Magbikin tribe in Kanawan, Morong, Bataan, to survive in a modern world that has outpaced their traditional way of life. Lacking modern education and unable to find permanent jobs, the family counts on hunting wild bees for honey as their primary source of livelihood. 
The documentary takes off from the theory of cultural transfusion and acculturation. In acculturation, members of one cultural group adopt the beliefs and behaviors of another group. Most of the time, acculturation occurs in the direction of a minority group adopting the beliefs, language pattern and habits of the larger group. This results in a loss of ethnic identification. 
By capturing the day-to-day events in the life of Nanay Emmy Restum, Tatay Jose 'Ute' Restum and their children, Domeng and Duday, the documentary depicts the pervasiveness of acculturation among most Ayta tribesmen in Kanawan. How instead of speaking their native tongue, the Magbikin dialect, they converse in the lowlanders' Tagalog. The apparent loss of their cultural identity is mirrored in the clothes they wear, the dwelling they have constructed, and the tools they use in their daily lives.

From the point of view of ""cultural transfusion,"" the documentary points out the effects of modernization on the Ayta family, taking into account the changes in their way of life and language, as well as economic prospects. 
Would integration with the mainstream culture be the key to Ayta survival, or instead bring about their downfall as a tribe? Would their ""exile"" and isolation doom them to poverty, or instead preserve their cultural integrity. 
This documentary attempts to be a snapshot of the struggles of the Kanawan Aytas today and tries to capture and preserve their story for future generations.",NATURE FILMS,fil,Doc.,15:57,"Empeno, Jena Rajni Caroline Aspa","Aspa, Carrie; Empeño, Henry; Cruz, Melvin; Mendoza, John Lee","Piano, Eduardo J.

 Hikbi is a short narrative shot on digital video format. The running time is seventeen minutes. The film tells about the story of a child raised in anger and continues to live with it. Deprived of a childhood- the throes of pain brought about by her father's abusive behavior, as well as her mother's consenting attitude perpetuated a cycle of hurt that left her scarred for life. 
Ever since she was a child, she had gotten used to swallowing her pain and locking it deep inside. She was treated just like the very gifts her father has been giving her. 
The day finally comes when she becomes face-to-face with her father- the man she had long been loathing. But this time, he is not capable of hurting her, touching her, seeing, hearing nor even feel his daughter's presence. 
Susan Schechter states that, a theory of violence against women in the family explains individual behavior more accurately. Will she be able to forgive and forget just because of her father's present condition? Or will the rational side of her take over her emotions. What is the right thing to do? It may be easy to forgive, but the struggle to is twice the pain.",HUMAN RELATIONS IN FILM,fil,Nar.,17min,"Reyes, Amaryllis Cantero","Clamor, Ma.

They say every story has two sides, and so is a story about love. 
My Girl follows the love story of Johnny, a man grieving because of the death of Jenny, the love of his life. The film starts with Johnny talking with a friend about his longing for Jenny. As he refreshes his memories of her, flashback of their sweet moments will be shown, up to the dark point when he found Jenny's dead body on her apartment. His reflection will be interrupted as his ""friend"" calls him and this time, with the revelation of Johnny in the asylum and actually talking with a psychologist, the other side of the story starts to unfold. The sweet memories of Johnny and Jenny were actually ""sweet"" only from the point of view of the delusional Johnny. Jenny does not know him really but because of his obsessive love for her, he makes himself believe that something romantic is going on between them, and actually plans to propose a marriage to her. But when the reality, that nothing is really going on between them, finally strike Johnny, he can not accept it. At the end it turns out that he is the one who killed Jenny. 
Erotomania, a psychological disorder in which the afflicted relentlessly pursues the notion that the object of his/her affection reciprocates his/her romantic feelings and fantasies, is the cause of Johnny's institutionalization. This romantic obsession continues even after the person has asserted that he/she is not interested with the afflicted. When his gestures go ignored and the other person continues to assert lack of interest, erotomaniacs may lead to anger, rage and violence.

 A young necrophilic embalmer... Power of the powerless... Helpless dead bodies.... Karma. 
 These are the images that constitute ""Laman-Loob"", a 20 minute narrative video, about Obet, a young embalmer who wanted to become a medical student someday. He started to engage in some necrophilic activities and executes power over the dead ones inside the morgue. And in order to survive, he got involved in illegal selling of body organs and dead bodies. Unfortunately, he ended up being the cadaver, experimented on by the medical students. 
 This short film focuses mainly on the sensitive issues regarding the illegal selling of dead bodies and organs from dead people, which is happening in our society right now. These destructive and inhuman activities show us how the powerless individuals in this system execute power in exchange for the services they give to others. 
 Another topic raised here is the concept of necrophilia, which is characterized by obtaining sexual gratifications from sexual interactions with dead people, craving for absolute control and executing power over the dead ones (www.crimelibrary.com). Again, a destructive way of showing how these powerless individuals find ways to execute their power in order to survive and to become powerful. 
 Since the film revolves in a psycho-drama genre, it contains images and scenes that are shot in low-key lighting set-ups in order to show the creepy atmosphere of the story. Most of the sequences will be interior scenes of the morgue in order to show the confinement of the characters here and for them to experience the feeling of being powerful in their territory. There is only one exterior sequence, the night police chase sequence. This is to show how the feeling of powerlessness will return to the main character as he moves out of his territory and goes out to the outside world where he could meet an authority figure, more powerful than he is. Repetitive montages of images of the main character's paranoia will also be seen in order to raise the ""psycho"" theme of the film. 
 As a whole, this short film will serve as a social commentary on a depraved system that can turn powerless individuals into powerful destructive ones in order to survive.","DEATH IN FILMS, WORKERS IN FILMS",fil,Nar.,19:49,"Ostani, Liarnie Lacambra","Ostani, Ernesto; Ostani, Lilia; Upton, Richard C.; Palma, Yam","Piano, Eduardo J.

 Through many dangers toil and snares We have already come T'was Grace that brought us safe thus far And Grace will lead us home Amazing Grace Amazing Grace 
 Is a reflexive documentary about the filmmaker's journey through the most trying time of her life. At the age of 19, she was faced with the difficulty of teenage pregnancy. Confused on whether to keep the baby or not, she informed her boyfriend about her situation and as expected, he left her. When her parents learned about it; her father refused to talk to her while her mother initially shocked and disappointed later stayed by her side. She entertained the thought of getting an abortion due to the pressure that the situation was bearing down on her. Love became the key to both saving the baby and her from making yet the biggest mistake most teenage mothers resolve as their easy way out. She rejected the idea of getting married, she was sent to Bicol to stay with a distant relative to at least spare her family of more shame that her early pregnancy was causing. Having no other options available, she heeded her parents' orders and months after, the baby came. Right there and then, having the baby in her arms, everything became worth it. He was worth all of it. But an unforeseen event came by when the father of the baby died. Finally setting them free from their suffering 
 The filmmaker realized how everything that happened in her life happened for a reason and has, ironically, helped put every piece of the puzzle in its proper place. Moved by this realization, she has dedicated her most important life's work-her thesis-to move other people's life as well. To help people experiencing her same dilemma to look beyond the criticisms of the society around them and listen to their heart, to the heart of the beating baby wanting to be born, wanting to experience life. It targets everyone to make critical judgments before jumping into any life altering decisions. The lesson her teenage pregnancy journey has brought to her, she hopes through this documentary will help those women going through the same ordeal. Her bravery under intense fire was rewarded ten folds. She wouldn't have come this far if not for the amazing grace.","CHILDBIRTH IN FILMS, YOUNG PEOPLE AND THE CINEMA",fil,doc.,12:46,"Suyo, Sharlyn Joy","Barnett, Richard; Ensemble, Makiling; Cruz, David","Alfonso, Grace Javier ",2005,"Manila, Philippines",14.65677,121.0672,UPFI Student Thesis AV Collection,UPFI000220,Image;MovingImage,image/jpeg,2024-01-05 (Created),2005_AmazingGrace.m4v,Educational use only,https://mainlib.upd.edu.ph/university-archives/revised-policy-on-access-to-theses-and-dissertations-2017/

 ""Biskleta"" is a short film that tells the story of a young girl running away from her past. She was an orphan who went through many abuses and difficulties from the orphanage to the first family who adopted her. Until she met an old lady who became the family she had always longed for. From the point of view of the oppressed the film unfolds and shows two opposing faces of oppression and love, of desperation and hope. ""Bisikleta"" clearly shows and states how people do not always have control over their situation or circumstances. How they do not always get to choose what happens. But what is in a person's power is the ability to respond rightly to his or her situation. This is what creates the difference, it is what moves people. 
 This short narrative is shot in video format and it runs for about 16 minutes. Although it is in the narrative genre, the style and method of story telling is unique and has that experimental and dynamic look. Because the story starts in the middle when the young girl was on the road running away in a bicycle and then random images appears that in turn weaves the story of her life. From the flashback the story moves to the present again. Everything will be told while she is on the road.
 The film is supported by two theoretical frameworks: Humanistic and feminist views. Humanistic because the film upholds a positive message that in the midst of hardship and pain a person goes through, there is hope, and there is, in each individual an inner strength to help others out. And feminist because it depicts an image of a woman being capable of standing up on her own and making decisions despite being looked down upon or stereotyped in society. 
 ""Bisikleta"" unlike any other film is a depiction of what life usually is; full of oppression and pains. Yet it is also a depiction of what life should be; hopeful, purposeful, like there is always a tomorrow. 
 Juxtaposing the video and the audio plans to bring forth a dialectical reading of the film. To create a deeper meaning about childhood and another create perspective of how we look back at our past. It seeks to find a story beneath the story, a picture beneath the picture.",HUMAN RELATIONS IN FILM,fil,Expe./ doc.,14:59,"Arguelles, Nicole Therese P.; Solis, May Victoria C.","Sayo, Miela; Venturanza, Yscka; Ramos, Carmen; Ang, Ruby","Alfonso, Grace Javier ",2005,"Manila, Philippines",14.65677,121.0672,UPFI Student Thesis AV Collection,UPFI000221,Image;MovingImage,image/jpeg,2024-01-05 (Created),2005_Bisikleta.m4v,Educational use only,https://mainlib.upd.edu.ph/university-archives/revised-policy-on-access-to-theses-and-dissertations-2017/

 Most of the time, you do things the way others expect you to do. You move as if everyone's eyes are on you and you try your best to conform to what is set by the society. But sometimes, you just have to be yourself.
 
 Shane is a girl who embodies masculine behavior. At her age, she is not yet aware of the ""standaril norms"" that her society dictates. And so, her masculinity naturally comes out of her. But not until when her parents noticed her behavior. She was forced to change, to learn the things women ought to do, which in effect made her so uncomfortable and unhappy.
 
 But do we really have to act like a woman to be a woman? Do we have to do things boys normally do in order to be a boy? Do we have to follow what the society dictates even if we sacrifice our own happiness, or worst than that, lost our identity as unique individuals?
 
 These are the questions that this 13-minute narrative film will try to answer, with its light drama and comic scenes mostly based on the childhood experiences of the filmmakers. The film will show the struggles of the main character as she tries to conform to what the society expects of her. Shane finds comfort on the arms of her bestfriend, Benedict, who understands her.
 
 In the end, character realizes that she doesn't need to change. She doesn't have to conform because she can be what she really is and be happy with what she is.","GENDER AND THE CINEMA, CHILDREN IN FILMS",fil,Nar.,13:34,"Gacer, Ma.

 Following the demise of her mother, Dominique is reunited with her father years after her parents separated. One would expect a happy reunion. But Dominique, who has been speaking her mother’s language all her life, now finds herself in conflict with her-father who seems to have a language all his own. She wants to be an auto-mechanic, a fact with which her father cannot reconcile. Who will have to learn whose language?
 “Talyer” is a 14-minute film about Dominique’s pursuit of her dream. It also touches on women’s sisterhood in face of strife, on their strengths to fight back when provoked and assert themselves when tied down to their traditional roles. It is also about the love between a parent and a child, about the former wanting to take care of the latter as much as he can. Ultimately, Talyer is about one’s right to make personal decisions and choices, and freedom to grow out of the dictates of a sexist society.","CARS IN FILMS, WORKERS IN FILMS",fil,Nar.,14:40,"Celebre, Julie","Celebre, Lilian; Celebre, Paul; Anden, Aurie; Ilarde, Feddie","Alfonso, Grace Javier ",2005,"Manila, Philippines",14.65677,121.0672,UPFI Student Thesis AV Collection,UPFI000225,Image;MovingImage,image/jpeg,2024-01-05 (Created),2005_Talyer.mp4,Educational use only,https://mainlib.upd.edu.ph/university-archives/revised-policy-on-access-to-theses-and-dissertations-2017/

 An uncommon way of storytelling for a very common tale, TULOG NA, is about reaching breaking points and concealing emotions.
 Dwelling on the topic of passivity and perception, the film is an experimental narrative about a young woman's nightly routine that is repeated for three times. Each repetition, brings the camera closer with the use of long shots, medium shots, close ups and point of view shots that slowly reveal the character's situation and psyche. This style of storytelling is being employed in order to give weight to the dilemmas of the character that would explain her chosen solution or plan of action and be able to communicate the differences in perception as one looks more closely into a situation.
 Making use of Strassman, Thaler and Schein's concept of apathy, Jean Paul Sartre's Existentialism, Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs and the concept of art and counter-cinema supports the concept and the unconventional approach the filmmakers decided to take.

And we always find it difficult to answer. We are all part of a conservative, traditional society, which value family so much that is tends to impose marriage as a necessity for all women, especially those who get pregnant early.
 
 The exactly what happened to Yna Marteriz, our heroine, whose dream to dance and perform on the stage was shattered by marriage. Controlled by her husband, repressed by their friends’ expectation, and worried about her daughter’s future, Yna decide to use silence and imagination as instrument for survival before she decides to liberate herself.
 
 In this fifteen-minute video, narrative and dance are interspersed to show Yna’s stream of consciousness, as her struggle to be her own person.

 I have always envied foreign animation icons. They dominate our local television and movies. Because of the lack of local cartoons. I have always yearned to create an animation based on Philippine literature and history. Lapu-Lapu is our first national hero. As such an important historical figure, I think he deserves to be acknowledged and become famous not only in history books and high school text, but also as part of our cultural icon. This Lapu-Lapu adaptation is my contribution in making Lapu-Lapu an icon. He can exist as a hero fiction and fact, or in history and literature. I want Lapu-Lapu to be an icon found in comic books, cartoon, games, novelty item, film and TV series, just as what Darna and Panday has become, as famous soap-opera characters.
 This animation is my own version of Lapu-Lapu, whom I can identify with-an icon of local content. My story adds several characters and twist to give more momentum in building Lapu-Lapu’s character and from an ordinary slave to becoming a DAtu of Mactan. What made him Datu is not of royal rights but of inner strength and character. 
 Based on my research, I learned that there are several versions of Lapu-Lapu history. Online encyclopedias differ in their text and there are ongoing research disproving Pigaffeta’s journal. From which mush of history is based. Moreover, these historical accounts focus on Magellan and little has been noted about Lapu-Lapu. I do believe that Pigafetta’s journals are not accurate. His journals are biased to save his life from the wrath of the king of Spain. I believe that history should be changed to reflect other research, including oral history passed from generations. Since there are so many versions of this part of history, I made several changes to story of Lapu-Lapu. I added several interpolated characters and changed some events. These changes reflect what I believe transpired during those times. I am in essence revising history by putting historical figures like Lapu-Lapu and Magellan in a fictional setting.",HISTORY IN FILMS,fil,Ani.,17:29,"Jusay, Alexander Hernandez","Yumul-Jusay, Kristine Joy; Jusay, Thomas","De Guzman, Anne Marie G.

 Perception is a very complex thing. It entails the appearance of events or objectives relative to one another determined by their distance to one another determined by their distance to the viewer. It varies so much, the factors that affect it almost cannot be determined. Every circumstances perceived by every person, is wholly different. Factors like environment, culture, status, even the person itself plays a big part in determining perspective.
 At the most literal level, human consciousness consists entirely of imagery of the world from the sense data that surrounds us. Light enters through our eyes and sound waves enter through our ears. We touch things to feel them and we put things in our mouth to taste them. We smell airborne particle through our noses. From all of this data our minds make mental images that help us to survive and to reproduce. The human mind is also able to remember mental images in order to associate them with each other, to compare then to others, and to form useful theories of how the world works based on likely sequences of mental images. 
 Mental images are not restricted to our perceptions of the environment. Human also have the ability to recall images from the past, and to integrate various memories. We can imagine and create images. This ability includes being to look inward, and to form a mental image of ourselves, and of our activities – this is the basis of consciousness. 
 Sensory input tends to be dominated by visual data, and mental images are often visual in nature.
 Our long term memory usually consists of the most powerful elements in each person’s memory. Bright colors, loud sounds, unexpected events, that seem to strike parts of our brain in ways we could not understand. We are saying this in the case of children. Their capacity to comprehend is a very empirical level, still at the process of taking it in, and evaluating it as they grow older, and finally understand it when it occurs again.",,fil,Expe.,4min,"Gauzon, Ma.

 Filipinos are truly fond of love stories, and I am no different. Having been raised believing that love should conquer all, I have always known that, one day, I shall also make a love story that will overcome all boundaries.
  This is a story about a straight guy who leads an average, everyday life who has never questioned anything until he meets a mysterious woman while waiting for a taxi. Deeply infatuated with her, he takes her up on her offer to watch her show at the bar where she works and discovers, to his disbelief, that she is actually a he! Now, he is suddenly confronted with a situation that will make him seek answers to the questions he has never asked himself before, and perhaps even open himself up to a whole new world of possibilities. 
 Let's face it - we are all just human beings with the same pains, joys and desires, and who all just want to love and be loved in return. Tackling this story introduces not only a new twist to the formulaic love story that we have grown so accustomed to, but it also shows the real nature of human beings when faced with the dilemma of choosing to follow the rules society has long ago set, or to deviate and create his own set of rules, risking all to find true happiness in the process. This is evident of the theory of Dramatism that Kenneth Burke has surmised, saying that life is a drama, which involves conflict and division that threatens some sort of existing order. What results from this conflict, however, us that the drama invites or discourages specific action from its actors. The sudden discovery by Ben that Sam is a transvestite threatens the norms of Ben's ""straight"" world, but it also spurs him into action - choosing between rejecting the discover, accepting it, or creating a compromise that will allow him to learn more about himself than society would have him to.","GENDER AND THE CINEMA, WORKERS IN FILMS",fil,Nar.,15:48,"Ong, Denise O.","Alim-Ong, William; Ong, Francen; Canaberal, Van","Lejano, Eduardo",2006,"Manila, Philippines",14.65677,121.0672,UPFI Student Thesis AV Collection,UPFI000239,Image;MovingImage,image/jpeg,2024-01-05 (Created),2006_Pwedeba.mp4,Educational use only,https://mainlib.upd.edu.ph/university-archives/revised-policy-on-access-to-theses-and-dissertations-2017/

 In a society people are still governed by mores and norms, non-conformists are almost often ostracized at or underestimated. This is true specially when it involves a question of one’s occupation. What if your job is macho dancing?
 In the Philippines, macho dancing is still considered a scandalous and an ignoble job. People always equate macho dancing with prostitution. There is a grain of truth to his generalization because macho dancing has always been associated with “easy money” in return for voyeuristic and/or sexual favors. It is work that requires only an Adonis- like physique and visage and certain boldness from the dancer to seduce and strip in front of exclusive audience willing to shell out wads of bills for a moment’s gratification. Macho dancing is thus a less popular yet a monetarily rewarding career options for young, poor and undereducated men.
 Not with standing this predicament, there are isolated eases of males who enter the job to satisfy their narcissistic proclivities. They work as macho dancer to be admired by people and in the process, worshipped for their handsome feature. Narcissism, then, can be a motivating factor for some to work as macho dancers.
 Narcissism is named after ancient Greek myth of Narcissism who was a handsome Greek youth who rejected the desperate advances of the nymph Echo. In punishment of his cruelty, he was doomed to fall in love with his own reflection in a pool of water. Unable to consummate his love, he pinned away and change into the flower that bears his name to this very day, still admired by people for its beauty.
 The short film “Hubad” explores this unique but equality compelling reason why man decides to work as a macho dancer although the protagonist in the film is not necessarily destitute. Given a postmodern approach to treat the subject, the film explores the stereotyped world of gay bar dancers. More importantly, it emphasizes that something beyond money or survival may be the main motive for one to enter this job. It represents narcissism as well as the gratification one derives from the fetishistic gaze by people as immense driving forces for a person to jump into the bandwagon of macho dancing. It attempts to advance the idea that these reason are more rewarding than money.","GENDER AND THE CINEMA, WORKERS IN FILMS",fil,Nar.,21:22,"Celiz, Rey Natabio","Celiz, Reynaldo; Domingo, Nor; Dating, Apol, Amparo James","Cantor, Olivia",2006,"Manila, Philippines",14.65677,121.0672,UPFI Student Thesis AV Collection,UPFI000246,Image;MovingImage,image/jpeg,2024-01-05 (Created),2006_Hubad.m4v,Educational use only,https://mainlib.upd.edu.ph/university-archives/revised-policy-on-access-to-theses-and-dissertations-2017/

 It is said that each of us is entitled to have a fifteen-minute fame at least once in our lives. Once we get a taste of that fame, it is hard to let it pass away. But like brightly lit theater lights, prominence gradually loses its radiance. This is the sad realization one stage performer faces in his life, the Performer in our film, One-Man Show.
 One-Man Show is a fifteen-minute narrative presenting a continuous decline of a Performer, condensed in three separate but related performances. The first act shows the Performer in his prime, days when bright lights and adoring fans still shower him. He gives his best” performance while lights dance about him. But when the music changes along with time and audience preference, he gets confused. He tries to catch up with the fast music but he fails. The second act shows the Performer, years later, still doing his old routine and singing his old song, only now in a far less accommodating environment: the then bright and grandiose theater is now blandly lit, and the cheers and applause he hears before are replaced by boos and taunts. The new lyrics of his song illustrate his current state: a forgotten star. The third act shows the Performer, now aged considerably, going back to his old theater, ostensibly reminiscing his past. He pushes the topmost step of his set, which used to stand high, toward the last remaining rays of light, and gives his final performance. He sings his trademark song; this time though, there is no musical accompaniment at all. His timeworn hoarse voice resounds in a seemingly empty theater. In these three acts, the Performer declines at a constant rate while all the elements of fame and glory gradually leave him. The once dazzling theater is now a cold, desolate shelter for his memories as a star, a place fit for someone who lives in faded glory.
 When all the lights die down, will the Performer cease believing in himself as well? As he bows down to end his performance, a desolate clap is heard. At the audience is his younger self, applauding wholeheartedly. unconditionally, at his older, unappreciated self.",ACTORS,fil,exp,15:00,"Ituriaga, Glenn; Sarmiento, Dohna","Ituriaga, Amy; Ituriaga, Felinor; Templonuevo, Cerila; Sarmiento, Patricia; Atinaja, Armi","Cantor, Olivia",2006,"Manila, Philippines",14.65677,121.0672,UPFI Student Thesis AV Collection,UPFI000249,Image;MovingImage,image/jpeg,2024-01-05 (Created),2006_One-manShow.m4v,Educational use only,https://mainlib.upd.edu.ph/university-archives/revised-policy-on-access-to-theses-and-dissertations-2017/

 What is personal is beautiful. This is what Pinakamagandang Pelikula is about. 
 It is of common understanding that the film is obviously that of the filmmaker. The film is where all his vision, his meaning and his intentions meet and materialize. It is his film. Panakamagandang Pelikula wants to offer another perspective. It shows that a film is as much the viewer’s as it is the filmmaker’s. it gives the film to both the filmmaker and the audience who could both be moved by the same film, although in different ways. Through the film, a connection is made between the filmmaker and the audience based on their personal meanings. Ultimately, in this ability to make a connection between the audience and the filmmaker is where the beauty of a film comes from.

  What is good what is evil? Indeed, any person would agree that in our lives, there is such a thin line between the good and the evil acts. Every person’s decisions and actions are so complex that it can be debated upon if it could have been the right thing to do and life we will see the door of the questionable act as an offender or not. This thin line between wright and wrong, the good and the devil act, this is where the fascination of the filmmaker lies. To the filmmaker, it is so parodic that a person tends to do good-well at least according to the filmmaker’s point of view, yet, when they see that the circumstances hold them on their necks, mostly, the same person will save himself instead: that’s human nature over divinity.
 
 The good act that turns out to be otherwise due to circumstances, this is the heart of the film that the filmmaker wants to do. The filmmaker talks about a character of very much the same attitude and personality as his: one who takes pride in doing good. It tells a story of a tricycle driver who takes pride on what he does and draws happiness in his good acts. Yet, on the other hand, the filmmaker as well exposes that there’s always a limit to one’s pursuit for divinity, and those bounds are kept by them nature. That when the same tricycle driver finds himself in a double-sided situation that might lead him to a much undesirable grounds, he still chooses to save the great part of him, with the least, filled with so much guilt and disappointment towards himself.
 The film also exhibits the filmmaker’s fascination towards the existing real-life human characters in our society. He plays with these representatives of the large chunk of society with their sometimes foul and too colloquial languages that could never cross the boundaries of Filipino understanding and culture. The jargon of terms, the seemingly stereotyped yet modernly bound characters like the preoccupied storekeeper, the prodigal lady child, the cussing professional etc., the micro-cultures of tricycle drivers, these feel will be so comically familiar to every Filipino who will be watching it they will surely stay put for the next twenty minutes of the film.","WORKERS IN FILMS, MOBILE DEVICES AND THE CINEMA",fil,Nar.,20:00,"Bais, Mariuz Reubin Balmores","Animas, Von Brian; Patubo, Aaron James; Parugannan, Nicko Arnel","Bautista, Ramon",2006,"Manila, Philippines",14.65677,121.0672,UPFI Student Thesis AV Collection,UPFI000252,Image;MovingImage,image/jpeg,2024-01-05 (Created),2006_Pasada.m4v,Educational use only,https://mainlib.upd.edu.ph/university-archives/revised-policy-on-access-to-theses-and-dissertations-2017/

 The filmmakers believe that prostitution is, for the most part, seen in a negative light by our predominantly Catholic society. As such, people involved in the flesh trade are then shunned by society and are prejudged, not even given the chance to tell their stories first. They believe that prostitution is something that is not immortal. Forcing someone, at the threat of life or property, into prostitution is immoral, but prostitution itself is devoid of any immortality. It’s even a preference for others.
 They also believe that love is something more than the ideal notion we grew up listening to. “Love makes the world go round” and such are quotes we have grown accustomed to, hence it is ingrained in our consciousness. But love is something much more complex than that. The filmmakers believe that love will always be subject to people’s priorities in a life. It will NOT keep one alive.
 This thesis documents the product of a fifteen-minute narrative video production. Pasensya Na is a story that follows Susan, a prostitute, as she works and unwittingly searches for love in the men one happy. This story involves the harsh reality of relationships and people’s priorities in life.

 The narrative thesis Gabon (Cloud tells that story of Maranao) girls who even after death, goes back to school to finish an exam. The films show the extent of the girl’s filial love, and how only through the parent’s act of letting go can the child break off from her earthly duties. 
 The 18-minute short film shot in mini-dv 24pa benefits from the marriage of the advanced digital imaging medium with the “likeness” of film movement, easily rendered in this format. Through which the filmmakers and weight into this classic tale of a ‘’ghost child’’.
 The use of silence and minimal dialogues us intentioned to highlight the gestures and visual nuances of the scenes. Music and natural sound is used to enhance the mythical and ritualistic quality of the story.
 The film aims to show the inherent power of telling stories. They serve as “reenactments”, through which we are able to exorcise aspects of childhood fears and fantasies, and become necessary inductions to one’s individuality and identity. Through the reenactment of “simply finish a task,” the ghost child in this story is able to seek love and find closure.
 For the filmmaker then, this film would have succeeded if it is not deemed only as a ghost story, but as a universal tale of love.
 In his major contribution to psychology Man and his Symbols (J.G. Ferguson Publish, 1964), Carl Jung states childhood as an “intense period of great emotional intensity, and a child’s earliest dreams often manifest in symbolic form the basic structure of the psyche, including how it will shape the destiny of the individual concerned”.
 From childhood, one reenacts this unconscious (but inherent) inheritance (and birthright) from our ancestors into his “own” rituals.
 The filmmaker aim with this thesis to further explore childhood themes earlier tackled in his student works and later professional projects: the separation and tragic reunion of a son to a guerilla father (Pula Sa Bughaw); and fisherman’s child from the Island Guimaras symbolically rebuilding his sense of home and protection in the oil-slicked mangroves (Spill); and the heartbreaking chance encounter of a prostituted woman with her long lost son, a young man seeking connection (Sarong Banggal). 
 Finally, this thesis gives the filmmaker another chance to contribute to the literature of “children in cinema”, as he was also inspired early in his filmmaking with such cinematic masterworks on children as Francois Truffaut’s Les Quatre Cent Coups (The 400 Blows) and Victtorio De Sica’s Ladri di biciclette (The Bicycle Thief).",ART IN FILMS,fil,Nar.,10:23,"Venturanza, Davene O.","Banatao, Venturanza; Dante, Valencia, Leo; Sarmiento, Dohna; Gohetia, Charliebebs","Bautista, Ramon",2006,"Manila, Philippines",14.65677,121.0672,UPFI Student Thesis AV Collection,UPFI000255,Image;MovingImage,image/jpeg,2024-01-05 (Created),2006_StillLife.m4v,Educational use only,https://mainlib.upd.edu.ph/university-archives/revised-policy-on-access-to-theses-and-dissertations-2017/

 “CANIS FAMILIARIS” is a video documentary on how various forms of media particularly Hollywood and local celebrities have influenced the ownership of domesticated dogs and treating them as an accessory. 
 The film deals with the issue of the rise dog ownership and dogs as an accessory, as a form of a status symbols, and how it is i9nfluenced by Popular Culture based on Gramci’s definition that Popular Culture is what men and women makes from their active consumption of the texts and practices of the culture industries. Furthermore, Gramsci’s explains popular culture as how a phenomenon relates to the matters od ideology and social class.
 With the increasing demand of dog aficionados wanting to own a dog and pampering and spoiling it to the best way they can, just like what they see on TV advertisement or people and local and international celebrities, we can say that dogs as an accessory have become a form of pop culture, which, based on Neo-gramscian theory defines as a site of struggle between the forces of resistance and subordinate groups in society and force of incorporation of dominant groups in society. Because not everyone can own a specific breed of dog because of financial capability and sustainability, owning dog with high end breeds have also become a form of struggle to those who want that certain breed but can’t afford it, whereas, those who can afford it more than not, flaunt their prized possession which signifies their status in society and their wealth. 
 This video documentary is 21 minutes long and through visuals, it is how people treat their dogs either as living animals and pets, or as accessories. The video documentary also contains interviews with pet lovers, dog aficionados, pet accessories and food retailers, officer of organizations dealing with breed verification, and veterinarians. The interviewers reveal the upside and downside of caring for dogs either as pets or as mere possessions.",SOCIETY IN FILMS,fil,Doc.,0:27:35,"Briones, Deanne Louise G.;  Mella, Adrian Carlo V.","Briones, Edgar; Mella, Dong","Alfonso, Grace Javier ",2006,"Manila, Philippines",14.65677,121.0672,UPFI Student Thesis AV Collection,UPFI000258,Image;MovingImage,image/jpeg,2024-01-05 (Created),"2006_SaPatay,saBuhay.m4v",Educational use only,https://mainlib.upd.edu.ph/university-archives/revised-policy-on-access-to-theses-and-dissertations-2017/

 This film revolves around the conflict of man vs himself. 
 Kolor is story about a young adult who tries to build his own character but pressure of society and the continuous haunting of his past won’t let him do so. Marco is faced with an ironic fate. He grew up trying to get away from violence for this was his traumatic past. But he just can’t because turning to violence is the only way for him to raise his daughter. He is asked to join the gang- a job that easily generates money. Now, Marco is caught in a dilemma between living a peaceful life that he will create on his own or entering the same life his father did with risks, and at the same time, benefits.
 The film shows the struggle of man to conquer all his internal conflicts. This narrative follows the framework of the Psychoanalytic Development Theory. The formation of the personality of an individual largely depend on 1) the way he brought up, and 2) the kind of relationship he is able to build with his parents while on that stage. People with very weak personalities are most likely the ones who create internal conflicts in them. How can a young adult like Marco face this responsibilities as a father when he cannot even face his own problems as a man? What is worse is that what he’s trying to run away from is the thing that he will soon turn to violence.",ANIMALS IN FILMS,fil,Doc.,21:36,"Fullido, Gretchen","Fullido, Geoffrey; Viray, Marco; Maralit; Maralit, Carl; Alido, Franco","Santiago, Arminda V.",2007,"Manila, Philippines",14.65677,121.0672,UPFI Student Thesis AV Collection,UPFI000259,Image;MovingImage,image/jpeg,2024-01-05 (Created),2007_CanisFamiliaris.m4v,Educational use only,https://mainlib.upd.edu.ph/university-archives/revised-policy-on-access-to-theses-and-dissertations-2017/

 Ang Tutos ay isang kwento ng samahang pinagtibay ng panahon.
 Sastre sa isang maliit na baryo, si Rey ay isang striktong ama sa dalagang si Elena. Si Elsa naman ay nasa kolehiyo at nagnanais na maging isang mahusay na manunulat. Dahil sa kawalan ng ina sa tahanan, lumaki siyang brusko at karaniwang binansagang “astig” na madalas ikagalit ng kanyang ama. Ang kwento ng kanilang buhay ay isinasalaysay ni Boyet, ang pinakamatapat na katrabaho at kaibigan ni Rey sa tahian.
 Nagkaroon ng malalang atake sa puso si Rey na nagging dahilan upang huminto sa pag-aaral si Elsa. Sa halip na sumayaw sa kagustuhan ng ama, ginamit ni Elsa ang kaganapang ito upang makasulat ng isang obra maestro-ang kwento ng kanilang buhay.
 Upang maipakita sa manood ang ideya nais ilarawan ng pelikulang ito, ang kwento ay nakapokus sa dinamiks at kasalimuutan ng relasyon ng isang strkto at biyudong ama at “astigin” na anak na babae, batay sa pagsasalaysay sa isang kaibigan ng ama. Ipinapalagay ng manunulat na ang pagpapakita ng relasyon ng kalagatan ng mga kabaihan sa isang partriyarkal na Sistema. Samantala, ang di-pangkaraniwang personalidad ng pangunahing tauhang babae laban sa tipikal na karakter ng ama ay isang tahasang pagsalungat sa lipunang patriyakal sa postmodern na panahon.
 Ang metikuso at detalyadong paglikha ng sastre (karakter ng ama) sa isang pantalon ang ginamit na metapora ng manunulat para sa paraan ng pagpapalaki niya sa anak na babae. Ito ang nagsilbing tulay upang hubugin ang karakter ng pangunahing tauhang babae na siyang nagging representasyon ng paglihis sa mga stiryotipikong paniniwala.
 Tatlomng teorya ang ginamit upang suportahan ang mga pahayag ng Tutos. Una ang Relational Dialectics nina Leslie Baxter at Barbara Montgomery na nagpaliwanag ng iba’t-ibang masalimuot na relasyon ng mga oangunahing tauhan. Ikalawa, ang Psycholoanalytic Theory ni Sigmund Freud na nakapokus sa defense mechanism na siyang nagbibigay-kasagutan sa mga katanungang maaring nakapaloob sa personalidad ngmga taong kabilang sa mga nasabing relasyon. Ikatlo, ang Feminist Film Theory na ayon sa pagsusuri ni Adrienne Rich na nagbigay linaw at suporta sa personalidad ng pangunahing tauhan na babae.",WORKERS IN FILMS,fil,Nar.,20:07,"Yamsuan, Louise Anne M.","Locsin, Mark; Relagio, Herbert; Balajadia, Dorothy; Mortil, Erika","Alfonso, Grace Javier",2007,"Manila, Philippines",14.65677,121.0672,UPFI Student Thesis AV Collection,UPFI000264,Image;MovingImage,image/jpeg,2024-01-05 (Created),2007_Tutos.m4v,Educational use only,https://mainlib.upd.edu.ph/university-archives/revised-policy-on-access-to-theses-and-dissertations-2017/

 Burnayan is an 18-minute narrative film shot on digital video. It is about an oppressive father-and-domesticated son relationship. Burnayan presents how victimization and liberation take place in a household, a microcosm of the patriarchal society.
 The film aims to rationalize that the attainment of justice and freedom requires elimination of the roots of expression. Burnayan is a melodrama with political undertones which state that the death of the father is the death of the abusive authority. It aims to expose the relationship of the power and oppression in molding sexual, political and social identities.","WORKERS IN FILMS, HUMAN RELATIONS IN FILM",fil,Nar.,18:14,"Pamintuan, Kacey Anne Grace","Pamintuan, Leoniza; Gourdley, John; Dela Cruz, Martin; Claravall, Hermann

 Para sa isang bayan na kung saan matagal-tagal ding namuhay ang mga tao nang nakayapak, mahirap paniwalaang nakatatak ang sapatos sa pinaka-kaluluwa ng mga Pilipino. Makikita rin sa iilang nakatalang ang record ng mga Pilipino sa Guiness Book of Word Records, dalawa rito ay patungkol sa sapatos; ang isa ay para sa koleksyon ng sapatos ni Imelda Marcos at ang pangalawa naman ay ang pagkilala bilang bayan na kung saan makikita ang pinakamalaking pares ng sapatos sa mga pinagdaanang hirap ng mga Pilipino, pati ang kanilang paghanap sa kanilang pagkakakilanlan bilang isang lahi.

 Mia lost her mother, Elena, as the latter was rushing to Mia’s grand violin recital. The tragic and sudden passing of Elena leaves Mia and her father, Dante, in a state of unease and devastation. Elena had been their bridge because Dante and Mia were not close to each other. Dante worked abroad and his work, although it made them survive, distanced him far from his daughter. Dante, however, got sick and never worked abroad again because of health and age concerns. Dante depended on Elena physically, emotionally and financially since Elena worked as a Music professor and a performing artist. Mia depended on Elena for her inspiration and her music. She was her mentor. Elena’s abrupt death brought Mia and Dante to unbearable pain. Dante cannot accept the loss because he thinks that Mia blames him for it. If he agreed to accompany Elena to Mia’s recital, he would have saved her. Mia thinks that her father, Dante, blames her because her mother died going to her grand presentation. She leaves it at that assumption. Her father copes really hard but does not really blame her. They live in the most deafening and painful silence. Our story will show the healing time of hearts that do not want to be healed, or two persons who do not wish to be reconciled. They refuse to communicate with one another. They sleepwalking trying to cope with the death of Elena’s spirit on the other hand remains in their house, she observes her husband and daughter grieve and try cope up. She performs the usual things she did before her death and acts as if she is still alive.

 This narrative film is a journey inside Norman’s imagination and creative motivations. Norman is a struggling artist who is stretched into opposite directions by his true passion and the graphic novel word showcasing “living” his different states of mind in succession with his dream graphic novel.
 “Belief strengthens truth” is the central theme of his film. This film supports Gilles Deleuze’s idea of “Cinema of the seer and no longer the agent.” Coinciding with the main character’s decision-making, this film also elicits active participation from the audience. The viewer is given the chance to believe in what the actual story and time-frame of the film is. Nevertheless, the film still highlights the distinction between its objectively in relation to its audience and its subjectivity to the main character as it is treated just like a brief peek inside Norman’s mind.

 Our film centers on the inner psychological and psychical struggles of young woman battling through with a dilemma that pits the external societal expectations of her sexuality against her real self. 
 
 In a situation where a person’s right to freedom of choice in life is subjected under complete manipulation by the pre-mediated events surrounding the circumstances that bind her, we witness how a conscious feministic mind create a solution for her own sake to the best of her future interest and strength of person will. 
 The realization that each human being as the only rightful captain of one’s soul and destiny leads us to believe in the empowerment of a person’s honest decision. Although a certain “sacrifice” entailing another potential life is essential perpetuated within this specific journey, which may yield to be inevitably regrettable or otherwise, it become evident that the price of freedom for one soul may come at a costly state of moral abandon.","NURSES IN FILMS

But the fact remains that they still employ humans to do some work that machines still cannot perform on its own. Surely not all of these companies and institutions treat their laborers as badly as the others in the name of profit but it is a fact that even the largest single owner of real estate in the world does contractual employment.

 The necessity of resistance is the motivation behind the making of Manwal sa Paggawa ng Pelikula. Done in the format of a metafilm, Manwal highlights dissatisfaction as a prerequisite to change, wheter within the cultural sphere, as in filmmaking, or within the political structures of current society 
 
 Manwal is the story of Orly, a young filmmaker who is determined to realize his pet project: a digital remake of Ishmael Bernal’s classic Himala. His film concept is poorly received by his peers and professor, yet a strange encounter with a divine boat drives him to persist in his goal. Himala 2007’s starts include has-been actors Gay Paradise and Jule Madigan, both desperate for a showbiz comeback. Orly’s production is riddled with disaster; even Himala 2007’s premiere night is horrific flop. Still Orly emegres happy with his work. The audience, however- most of them his own crew members-are not as satisfied.
 
 Dissatisfaction, as emphasized in the conclusion, is central to the film since it highlights the necessity for change, whether within the cultural sphere, as in filmmaking, or in the political structures of current society. Disillusionment is a desire for change, and change cannot be achieved without a certain level of hostility. The reflexive gesture of Manwal’s interrogation of filmmaking is thus necessarily antagonistic, in the same way that any movement which seeks to oppose dominant structures will necessary produce conflict.

 High School is as integral part of our lives for it is here that one’s personality is molded. It is here, where one creates memories that he shall carry forever. But for someone who lives by the rules. High School can be only as a routine, thus stimulating that feeling of boredom.
 Boredom is very common to High School students in exclusive Catholic schools. Rules and uniformity are essential in such schools, and as a result, students tend to lack self-expression and self-identity. At this certain age, when one is in high school, a student has very limited ways and means meeting and socializing with other people other than with those school.
 When one bored, time seem longer but events seem to pass at much quicker pace. This normally occurs when one lives a routinely life.

 The film is about Istong Peñamante, a 68-year old grandfather, who finds himself in the same situation he was in more than two decades ago, 26 years after his brother’s abduction, his granddaughter who is an activist writer is abducted, becoming a victim of involuntary disappearance as well. The lives of the family members are interrupted and their strong bond is put to the test. For the second time, Istong is torn between two choices, to give in to hopelessness, or to continue fighting for his loved ones, and for himself.
 
 Probably one of the best gifts that we human have received from God is our freedom to choose. Yes, choices are powerful weapons and how we used it to our advantage or disadvantage is up to us. It can lead us to freedom or slavery, to victory or to default. In every situation that we are in, there will always be a saving grace for us, it is just a matter of choice in what to believe in, whom to believe in, and how to look at things in perspective. We are made up of a thousand choices in our live, and through our decisions, our character is reflected.","PRESS AND THE CINEMA, POLITICAL FILMS",fil,Nar.,0:25:18,"Alparce, Sierra Cecilia Coronacion","Cloma, Ernie; Buencamino, Shamaine; Laxa, Bernard; Cadawas, Arron","Cantor, Olivia ",2008,"Manila, Philippines",14.65677,121.0672,UPFI Student Thesis AV Collection,UPFI000285,Image;MovingImage,image/jpeg,2024-01-05 (Created),2008_Bihag.m4v,Educational use only,https://mainlib.upd.edu.ph/university-archives/revised-policy-on-access-to-theses-and-dissertations-2017/

 Human relationships are as complex as life itself. This is what the filmmaker explored in his production thesis entitled Kaliwaan. Having been exposed to all sorts of human interaction in his work, family and personal life, the filmmaker never stopped investigating the intricacies of human relationships. And interestingly, there are no two relationships that are alike. 
 Zooming in on the study of relationships between husband and wife, the film shows how love can escape the boundaries of time, space and reality. Faithfulness to your partner is an important ingredient in a relationship because it is the mother of trust, conviction and staying true to each other's expectations. But when faithfulness becomes an intangible concept, where does one draw the line? When is it time to move on and when is it worthy to keep holding on? What does being a man entail in a relationship? What is a woman's place in a relationship? 
 The result is an ambitious and daring account of an unusual affair that transpired for five days between two strangers. The story begins on a normal Monday and ends with an unexpected twist come Friday. What seems to be just another week at the office turns out to be a life-changing experience. If one week is all you have to fix what is broken, how do you even start? 
 The film is more of a memory than an ordinary turning of events. A woman with no past meets a man who needs to build his future.

 Ang Pagkagising is the story of woman as interpreted by the individuation theory of Carl Jung. Using universal symbols and archetypes, it tells the story of her creation, demise and present condition. The central character, Eve, awakens only after her Barbie archetype, Babae, frees herself from the cultural constraints she finds herself in. This is spurred by the growing discontent of the animus, remembering that she is made in the image of God and knowing that her subjugation is caused only by the fear of man. 
 The story fluctuates from video and animation as well as from planes of symbolic consciousness. Its form aims to recreate the fluidity of the feminine.

Language is a very important part of a country's identity. A country without a language, cannot have an identity for language is a very big part of culture.

The sad thing about it is that the Filipino people accept these cultures that are killing the culture that this nation once had.

 Abesamis, G.M. (2008). One Hundred Percent, Student Thesis, University of the Philippines College of Mass Communication. 
 One Hundred Percent is about a man in search for ultimate happiness. Ricky Torres, the protagonist, is a 50-year old rich, successful, intelligent, family-oriented, and good-looking businessman. He has a special power - he can see numbers on top of people (including himself), numbers which he assumes to be a numerical representation of happiness and success. This ability made him methodical and structured, following cues as to what activities, possessions, relationships, and other life aspects would make his number go up. What he realizes though, when he attends his father's wake, is that death is the last thing he has to accomplish to obtain his ultimate goal. At a time when he is so close to getting one-hundred percent, he struggles as to whether or not he would believe in death as the way to achieve ultimate happiness. 
 The film is a comment on how dominant ideologies dictate to society what happiness should be - western culture, material wealth, heterosexual romance, a loving family, etc. The number represents social norms we blindly and unconsciously follow, rules and standards which lead us to believing in specific concepts of ultimate satisfaction and fulfillment. The thesis used Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs and Plato's Theory of Forms as the main theories in the framework",HEALTH EDUCATION FILMS,fil,Nar.,24min,"Abesamis, Gersom M.","Baco, King Mark; Gonzales, Kariza; Tang, Thesa; Magno, Sandino; Yamsuan, Louse Anne","Banal, Jason",2008,"Manila, Philippines",14.65677,121.0672,UPFI Student Thesis AV Collection,UPFI000298,Image;MovingImage,image/jpeg,2024-01-05 (Created),2008_OnehundredPercent100%.m4v,Educational use only,https://mainlib.upd.edu.ph/university-archives/revised-policy-on-access-to-theses-and-dissertations-2017/

 However, these panoptic mechanisms, although ideally perceived to grant services for the welfare, have several hidden implications that may pull individuals back to subordination and enslavement. Individuals suffer from the experience of being watched.

 Hulagpos tells the story of a ten-year-old girl named Angeli who has a stern, cold and seemingly unfeeling mother named Maria. To prevent Angeli from going inside a forbidden room, Maria tells her daughter that a child-eating monster resides in there.

 I wanted to explore the social and psychological problems that closeted teenage gays have, and the issue of coming out for them. Hopefully, those who see the film will become more open minded about young gays and homosexuals in the country, and see that all relationships, whether same sex or not, are all equal.
  Problem:
  ""Coming out"" for the young teenage gay is still a horrendous process here in our country. We strive to change the taboo image of homosexuality to be able to give it a more liberated rein, and hopefully reduce some of the fear of the closeted gay teen in coming out.
 Approach: 
 Equations is a film that approaches homosexuality in a sense that makes it something that is not out of the ordinary gender-wise, but extraordinary because of the relationships; an intelligent young man, Vincent, defies the stereotypes of the homosexuality in the Philippines; the bakla. He does not cross dress, he does not act effeminately, and he's not loud. He is shown as just an ordinary human being yearning for love and finding out that it starts first by knowing, accepting and loving himself.
 Results: 
 This film and this study will hopefully provide a wider and more open-minded view in homosexuality, like that started by the ground- breaking film Ang Pagdadalaga ni Maximo Oliveros. 
 Conclusion: 
 Viewers of this film will go home more informed at the diversity of gay culture, and not just brand homosexuals in the terms of bakla or female-wannabes. In truth, they are human beings as well, same as the regular heterosexual male or female; they are just different in expressing the ways they love, as heterosexuals are different from them. And the stage of youth provides that atmosphere of experimentation, and generally, it is when a lot of gays find out and begin to accept who they are.",GENDER AND THE CINEMA,fil,Nar.,18:09,"Obligacion, Triccie Marie V.","Victoria, Eliza; Robles, Russel","Cantor, Olivia ",2008,"Manila, Philippines",14.65677,121.0672,UPFI Student Thesis AV Collection,UPFI000307,Image;MovingImage,image/jpeg,2024-01-08 (Created),2008_Equations.m4v,Educational use only,https://mainlib.upd.edu.ph/university-archives/revised-policy-on-access-to-theses-and-dissertations-2017/

  Pangungusap ng Sandali is a film about a young seamstress in the 1950's waiting for her soldier-husband's letter. The protagonist is trapped in their house and in the cycle of waiting. She talks with a living statue of the Resurrected Christ who questions and mocks her at the same time. When the mailman delivers the letter, she merely glances at it and does not open it. In the end she goes back to sewing in the sewing room, and the cycle of waiting starts again. I will be using the theory of Psychoanalysis in Lacanian terms and the construction of subject in relation to space and time. This is to say that the protagonist is constructing a sense of self-identity in relation to the house and to the relationships she has in her life.

 The commercial and economic viability of cities are reason enough for people to leave their provinces and settle here. Although frequently the outcome of this action leans more on the negative, considering endless stories of human trafficking, child abuse, and other forms of maltreatment that are very much common in urban areas, people still continue to stay in cities, despite its shortcomings. There may be other reasons after all.
 
 The atmosphere it provides to its people is essentially a point of comparison, as it is already common knowledge that fast-paced living in cities represents the good things in life the luxury of convenience, the social lifestyle, and, more importantly, the achievement of dreams. Just by keen observation, one can generally attest to this: Modern living is ideal, but deeply isolating.
 
 Imagine a jam-packed coliseum wherein everyone sits to watch a concert. No one knows anyone except those people in groups, but everyone is sure enough to stay. Apparently, the audience is not united by personal familiarity; what unites them is the concert itself -- the spectacle- -the idea that brings them in one place. That's how cities work. We don't know each other but we interact. We are propelled by common threads,
 
 but we work separately, we feel separately, and we cry separately. In the long run, it is not impossible to see a city void of human sound, people have pods plugged into their ears and verbal communication isn't at all necessary because PDAs are perfect enough to mediate, and all that remains are urban noises. This film explores the transition from the unified world to the atomized society, and how the richness of the urban mind morphs into a dull reflex of mechanical existence.

 The documentary is an advocacy for women who do not have the faculty or even the access and freedom to tell their stories. It is unfolding of the past and a visual narrative of the present lives of four women in Quezon City Female dorm. It tells how the women ended up in jail. It seeks to expose the maligned practice of law enforcers in haphazardly arresting Muslim women and pocketing the ‘bail money’ from their relatives. It take a look at the women’s living conditions inside jail as well as the progress (or the lack of it) in their cases.
 A series of interview with the four women reviled the different life situations they were in at the time of their arrest. One was working for her family and studying at the same time, one was a housewife, one had a baby, and one was a minor, only 15 years old when she was arrested.

 This thesis deals with the Filipino trait bayanihan or togetherness in common effort.
 In old times, where kubo or the Philippine traditional huts are carried or built by a group of people. It one a sense of identity as he/she is assigned to a role.
 
 Inevitably modernity and technology advancements are introduce to the society. And there are activities now that people can do by themselves with the help of modern day science having up-to-date gadgets and computers. Consequently person involved in group work may loss the opportunity to interact with the others as tasks become reassigned.
 
 Together with this. Western culture become more prominent promoting individualism and isolation, one that completely opposes Philippine culture that believe in unity 
 
 Eventually the idea of social interaction is viewed as a hindrance to personal growth. But in fact the value of social interaction gives each one an overview of the society that they live in thus helping one to find their own identity.
 
 The thesis hopes to make the people understand the more the Filipino trait of bayanihan removing any negative perspective toward this value. It’s not a mare conformance to a group’s ideologies but a way to find oneself through interaction, seeing their own as an equal to those they work with, giving them equal chances to find themselves and become better","CULTURE AND THE CINEMA, SOCIETY IN FILMS",fil,Ani.,5:25,"Grajo, Carlo; Raynera, Kay","Castro, Marella; Alarilla, Adrian; Aguila, Emmanuel","Jamon, Roehl ",2008,"Manila, Philippines",14.65677,121.0672,UPFI Student Thesis AV Collection,UPFI000316,Image;MovingImage,image/jpeg,2024-01-08 (Created),2008_IsangJuan.m4v,Educational use only,https://mainlib.upd.edu.ph/university-archives/revised-policy-on-access-to-theses-and-dissertations-2017/

 After the 1995 alleged rub-out of the Kalasag Gang - a notorious Mindanao mafia operating in Manila, Abel decided to go back to Misamis Occidental, the birthplace of Kalasag gang, to live a simple life by coconut farming. However, despite his struggle to change and to provide his son an education, things in the community get worse. A coconut processing plant is going to be closed and petty crimes like stealing livestocks become rampant. This film aims to get a closer look on the life of a man situated in a milieu where political and economic repression is inevitable: where capitalism made the masses poor; globalization made them poorer; and individualism chained them to remain poor. The character of Abel is an individualist who cries for change, not for the common good but only for himself.

 Metronome is about an individual who is confined within a defined social system, one of constant monotony and routine that dictates to the story's protagonist. This social system dictates to him how he should go about his everyday life, from his life at home to his workplace and defines his limitations inside a prescribed set of norms. 
 In the film, the lead character will be situated in a world that epitomizes the complete opposite of what can be perceived as his ""natural"" environment. This sudden shift from one social sphere to another is coined as a shock, as defined in the theory of Social Construction of Reality (Berger & Luckman, 1996). This ""shock puts the individual in a situation wherein he is suddenly confronted with a choice whether to go back to the previous environment where he is already accustomed to or risk staying in a new unfamiliar environment which presents uncertainty but, at the same time, has the potential to be more beneficial than the previous social sphere. To highlight the disparity of the two social environments, the filmmaker used music. Both worlds are constrained by music, specifically a tempo identified in the music used in the film. In the first world, everybody around the film's protagonist had to follow the same downbeat in the identified tempo. In the second world however, the people surrounding the film's protagonist learned how to work around this tempo, creating percussive music created by the normal found objects that can be described as imaginative, since it does not follow the same downbeat as the first world. The characters in the second world make full of use of the tempo and attack it with fervor, striking their beats in whatever window of opportunity that presents itself. 
 In the first part, the percussive music is monotonous and repetitive. In the second part, however, the music that is created is dynamic and plays around with its prescribed environment.",SOCIETY IN FILMS,fil,Expe.,6:58,"Magno, Sandino F.","Garcia, Sol; Ricio, Digo; Abesamis, Gerson M.; Locsin, Mark; Idanan, Ice","Banal, Yason",2008,"Manila, Philippines",14.65677,121.0672,UPFI Student Thesis AV Collection,UPFI000321,Image;MovingImage,image/jpeg,2024-01-08 (Created),2008_Metronome.m4v,Educational use only,https://mainlib.upd.edu.ph/university-archives/revised-policy-on-access-to-theses-and-dissertations-2017/

 The thesis film, ""Sayaw Tayo (Kahit Walang Musika),"" is an optimistic rendering of the idea of love as work. It serves as love letter and as an attempt to recreate dance with images. The thesis unites ideas about love and relationship, traditional symbolism, nonverbal communication, and color in film. It abides by the lyrical film tradition, in which the camera is infused with the consciousness of the filmmaker and behaves according to how the filmmaker sees and reacts to the visions, and applies Patti Bellantoni's study of color in narrative film, which is based on the idea that color can affect a person's thoughts or emotions.

 Abeledo,R.B.(2009). Araw ng Pighati, Student Thesis, University of the Philippines College of Mass Communication.
 Araw ng Pighati aims to understand the underlying reason behind the emotions experienced during the mourning for the dead. Pacific Dimaantal/Pico is an undertaker in his fifties, placing his dreams and prospect of a better life in the hands of his kind and loving son, Victor Dimaantal/Pico. Living alongside the cemetery, Pico has hoped to alleviate his current condition by way of his son’s education. He believes that by having his son graduate all the way through college would he finally be able to improve his own life- imposing his own preferences over his son’s personal choice. With the apparent death of his son’s caused by an accident, Pico is left to fend for himself, with his hopes and dreams defeated. At his son’s funeral, the main argument of the film is tapped-What is he really grieving for? The death of his son? Or the death of his dream? 
 
 The film attempts to portrays death in two aspects-literal and figurative. Literal being Toto’s physical death, and figurative being the death of both father and son’s individual dreams. The film is also a comment on funeral practices, the directly observable customs and traditions witnessed during funerals, and how death and grieving are valued in the Philippines context through the dialogues and commentaries expressed, by the ghost characters in the film.

 ""I want to create a movie for my family, a movie they can watch."" That was my mantra and inspiration from the conception and throughout the production of this short film. The viewing comfort of my parents, the main source of funding for this thesis, is of primary consideration. This short film ought to approximate a typical family oriented movie funny, light, cheerful, and non exorcist of unpleasant emotions and experiences. To engage my family further, my mother especially, I chose a story that they can relate to. This semi-autobiographical short film follows Sophia as she tries to sort out her life by going back to her hometown after being separated with her husband. During this transition stage, her son Kiko, apart from his father and his usual environment, will develop or meet an imaginary friend. Sophia eventually feels that the exorcism of her son's imaginary friend is the last ingredient to her imagined comeback to life. The story revolves around Sophia's funny and futile attempts to get rid of her son's imaginary friend, Tweaky. I chose to treat this short comedy with the aesthetics of Camp.

Adeya , from blue can, and Sinukuan, from the red, caught passion for each other, even though love between two of the different kind is forbidden.

 This thesis revolves around the analogy between the sport of boxing and the struggles that ordinary people face in their lives. Because boxing is such a popular sport in the Philippines, it serves a fitting metaphoric device in illustrating analogy. Differently people face different kinds of problems which entail different yet nonetheless legitimate ways of overcoming them. This illustrated metaphorically in the film through different boxing styles and other boxing elements. This was done through the story deals with three protagonists: a doctor, a hospital patient and a nurse. The story is set before, during and after the Manny Pacquiao-Oscar de la Hoya match, through boxing parallelisms, the character’s respective conflicts and obstacles are presented.","GAMBLERS IN FILMS, BOXING IN FILMS",fil,Nar.,19:03,"Alcala, Ana Iris Braga","Soliongco, Caloy; Espia, Hannah; Escueta, Ina; Garcia, Mara; Alcala, Angela","Campos, Patrick F.",2009,"Manila, Philippines",14.65677,121.0672,UPFI Student Thesis AV Collection,UPFI000343,Image;MovingImage,image/jpeg,2024-01-08 (Created),2009_HindiSumusuntoksaHangin,Educational use only,https://mainlib.upd.edu.ph/university-archives/revised-policy-on-access-to-theses-and-dissertations-2017/

It is used when in need of someone relate to one’s situation. It is seeking for assurance that one is not alone.

 Numbalikdiwa literally means ”return of the subconscious’’. The translation of the Filipino word diwa inherently comes from the series of discussions presented by Virgilio Enriquez in From Colonial to Liberation Psychology(1994). The proponent express great interest in the study and observation of people and varied process of thinking. Consequently, having read an array of essays and journals on the contentious study of the human subconscious, it is deemed generally interesting and provocative to experiment on the visualization of such. On the level of personal interpretation and the general limitations of this proposal, Numbalikdiwa ought to mean “the generic consciousness revisualized.’’ 
 The film is the proponent’s sixteen-minute attempt to visualize the Filipino subconscious through an emblem of a lethargic old man losing hope in the brink of demise. He finds false compassion from the different personas with three different intentions one entertains, one empathize. What is left of his capacity to save his own subconscious (diwa) is hindered by a personal battle to realize who or what to believe.

 Bottled Star takes as its subject the concept and practice of escapism in the modern age. Escapism is the practice of distancing yourself from the immediate present and seeking refuge in something else. Today, it has evolved to take on a multitude of forms and methods. We are offered so many ways to seek refuge from our problem through television, film, alcohol, and, most notoriously, the Internet. All of these can combine to form a more potent blindfold than religion. However, the relief these things
 Provide can keep people functional. And in fact fuel today’s capitalist society like a cycle of addiction and purchase.
 
  Indulging in escapism always comes with the possible effect of becoming out of touch with reality, and out of touch with other people. This thesis film portrays people surrounding themselves with commodified dreams and items that they do not really need, and these things blind them from seeing what the world has offer. Today’s economic and system readily provides us with multiple avenues of illusory happiness continuous stream until we become dependent upon them for what we believe to be our peace of mind.","FAMILY IN FILMS, HUMAN RELATIONS IN FILM",fil,Ani.,6:36,"Crisostomo, Mikki","Soliongco, Caloy","Felix-Esguerra, Abigael ",2010,"Manila, Philippines",14.65677,121.0672,UPFI Student Thesis AV Collection,UPFI000351,Image;MovingImage,image/jpeg,2024-01-08 (Created),2010BottledStar,Educational use only,https://mainlib.upd.edu.ph/university-archives/revised-policy-on-access-to-theses-and-dissertations-2017/

 This film is about the generation and degeneration of a person's memories. Memories can be reincarnated again in various ways. In this film, memories are given second life in the form of still pictures. The story takes place mainly in the mind of a woman, who gathers so much experiences throughout her life. In the end, she will get old and become forgetful, but will be able to preserve her memories by the pictures she has taken. Her time may pass and her human mind may weaken; but thanks to her photographs, her memories will stay. It is stated in Baudrillard's Theory of Hyperreality, ""the moment modernity exploded upon us is the moment of liberation in every sphere; and the only thing we can do after liberation has been achieved is to simulate that liberation."" In this film, the almost endless production of memories has brought liberation to the person who owns these memories. It becomes a repetitive cycle, and somewhat senseless. As the person who owns the memories get old and eventually die, the endless cycle of repetition is put to an end. As a redeeming factor, it is not all put to an end.

 The film is a glimpse of the history of an old religion called the Equifrilibricum World Religion, also known as the Moncadista. The filmmaker interviews her grandmother and the elder women members, shedding light to the once obscure religion and at the same time underscoring the mystery behind their faith. The elders recall their experiences, their practices, and personal struggle with the religion after their families migrated to Samal Island from different parts of the Philippines after World War II.
 The recorded narrative becomes a visual and oral history of the Moncadista members who were one of the first settlers in the island, which is situated in the Davao Gulf. The film develops into a personal act of understanding the filmmaker's Moncadista ancestors and as well as discerning her own identity as a Filipina.
 The film uses postmodern theories particularly Post feminism and the indigenous psychology (Sikolohiyang Pilipino) that caters to the marginal women of color who define the self and community through personal relationships and indigenous spirituality.",AGED IN FILMS,fil,Doc.,0:48:24,"Camporedondo, Pete Malaya","Camporedondo, Malaya; De Guia, Kabunyan; ","Alfonso, Grace Javier ",2010,"Manila, Philippines",14.65677,121.0672,UPFI Student Thesis AV Collection,UPFI000360,Image;MovingImage,image/jpeg,2024-01-08 (Created),2010_PanagtagposaAkongmgaApohan  (Panagtagpo sa akong mga apohan (The Day my grandmothers met) sa TUKLAS,Educational use only,https://mainlib.upd.edu.ph/university-archives/revised-policy-on-access-to-theses-and-dissertations-2017/

 Ignacio, R. E. (2010). Paghahati, Unpublished Undergraduate Thesis, University of the Philippines, College of Mass Communication.
 
 People have basic needs in order to survive. But gone are the days that people are just concerned with survival. People have grown accustomed to having more than what's needed. They don't accumulate to have something just in case something bad will happen in the future. They accumulate for the sake of having more. In society, having more of what most people need is the same as having power over them.

 Elloso, Ma. Fatima Aiza Mamasig. ""Senyalez"" BA thesis. University of the Philippines Diliman College of Mass Communication, 2010.
 Lesbians are a very rare sight in Philippine cinema. In the few films where there is a lesbian character, she is almost always shown as an unattractive, bad-mannered ""tomboy"" (butch lesbian) who likes to pick fights. She would also probably have vices like smoking, drinking and doing drugs. More often than not, she would also have a ""straight"" girl as love interest, who in the end will leave her for a ""true"" man. Either that or she gets raped and becomes a ""real"" woman.
 ""Senyalez"" seeks to divert from such negative portrayals and tragic story lines. It aims to break and go beyond the stereotypes by portraying lesbians in a positive light. It also makes use of camp and anime influences, as opposed to the usual dark and ""realistic"" approach in stereotypical lesbian films.","GENDER AND THE CINEMA, HUMAN RELATIONS IN FILM",fil,Nar.,0:35:32,"Elloso, Ma.

 After years of serving peacefully Feather Bautista moves to another parish where he is reminded of the old times and of old friends.
 
 Danny Cortez, a friend from Father Bautista’s youth welcomes him to the community with his family. Soon a scandal surrounding the Cortez family surfaces, Father Bautista finds out that Danny’s picture perfect family life may not be as picturesque as it seems.
 
 Being the only person who knows the details through sacrament of confession, Father Bautista chooses between saving a friend and fulfilling the vow he is bound to.
 
 The Canon 983 states that the sacramental seal is inviolable even if it means their death and the death of others. Violating the rule means excommunication from the church. 
 
 The confessional has always been a place where troubled souls, people go to share their problems. It is where they unload whatever is bothering them and a place where they generally receive some form of enlightenment from their worries.
 
 The film looks at how the confessional sometimes goes against its original design. If its main purpose is to help people, in this film it looks at how the rule becomes the reason as to how a priest can become powerless when certain problems arise. 
 
 
 The Law becomes the reason as to why our main character becomes paralyzed when it comes to helping his friends who come to the confessional. The system gives limitation on doing something good and gives emotional burden to the confessor.","PRIESTS IN FILMS, FAMILY IN FILMS, HUMAN RELATIONS IN FILM",fil,Nar.,21:41,"Darunday, Marjorie J.","Delos Reyes, Joseph; Evangelio, Jojo; Sales, Rommel; cardoz, Michael Christian; Habac, Jaime Jr.; Cabigon, Chad Angelic","Campos, Patrick F.

 Idlip is a thirteen-minute film that speaks of a child’s dream of obtaining the simple joy of childhood. It tells the story, traverses from the bitter cold world of reality to the warm world of fantasy and dreams.
 Inspired by the one of the most tragic fairytales, the film follows the story of The Little Match Girl by Hans Christian Andersen. Set in a modern Filipino setting. Idlip is a reinterpretation and a real life translation of this great fairytale that has long been written, forgotten and remained unheard by many. As an adaptation, the structure of the film remains truthful to the original story but some elements were altered to suit the idea of a modern-day Filipino setting.
 “An old story, retold.” Idlip aims to relieve the message of the classic fairytale by presenting it through the world more familiar to us.","SOCIETY IN FILMS, WORKERS IN FILMS",fil,Exp.,13:01,"Rabadam, Loren Jane","Garcia, Richond; Baco, King Mark; Cabral, Jefferson; De Guzman, Reign; Padilla, Abijoyce; Manatad, Carlo Francisco","Campos, Patrick F.

 Cabigon, Chad Angelic Duque. Ricochet. University of the Philippines Diliman. College of Mass Communication, 2010. Unpublished Undergraduate Thesis.
 Ricochet tells the story of a man who contemplates on a murder he committed. His plan
 
 to restore peace and to avenge his misfortune backfires when he kills an innocent man instead of a scoundrel. It narrates the story of a man dealing with his inner purgatory and the psychological death of his humanity.
 
 The film is about the repercussions of man's thoughts and actions in accordance to the people around him. We may have the best intentions but we may not have the proper solutions. When chaos arises we could possibly create more tribulations than resolutions, and with that we struggle to remain our sanity intact while trying to cover our sins.
 
 The film also highlights the technical capabilities of the medium in order to expressively communicate with its audience. It tries to be self-reflexive on the use of film as a medium to share new meanings not just those that were readily presented in the film as it exemplified concepts of Linda Hutcheon's theory on Metafiction (Hutcheon 2).",CRIME IN FILMS,fil,Expe/ nar.,17:36,"Cabigon, Chad Angelic D.","Cabigon, Phoebe; Bernal, Joyce; Camarillo, Catherine; Lavalle, Evy Rose; Mortel, Frances; Ignacio, Ela","Campos, Patrick F.

 Alarm explores the concepts of dreaming and reality. Dreaming is shown to help release repressed desires and frustrations, but also lead to confusion between dream and reality, when the dream becomes more real than waking life. The framework for this narrative is Freud's Psychoanalytic Theory of Dreams, which discusses how dreams and the unconscious are connected. In his book The Interpretation of Dreams, Freud wrote that are ""...disguised fulfillments of repressed wishes."" Central to this film is that idea- that maybe, when one's desires are too strong and too bottled up, dreams begin to encroach upon reality and blur the line between the two.","WORKERS IN FILMS, SURREALISM AND THE CINEMA",fil,Exp.,11:41,"Pascual, Joseph ","Pascual, Victor; Pascual, Jacqueline; Pascual, Joseph","Lejano, Eduardo",2011,"Manila, Philippines",14.65677,121.0672,UPFI Student Thesis AV Collection,UPFI000378,Image;MovingImage,image/jpeg,2024-01-08 (Created),2011_Alarm,Educational use only,https://mainlib.upd.edu.ph/university-archives/revised-policy-on-access-to-theses-and-dissertations-2017/

 Lim, Khamille (2011). Claudioismo, Unpublished Undergraduate Thesis, University of the Philipppines, College of Mass Communication.
 This film is a mockumentary revolving around a fictional rockstar-worshipping religion called Claudioismo in the village of Cataggaman, in Tuguegarao. The events of the film all take place in one day, on the eve of what the Claudioistas believe to be Claudio's second coming, or judgment day, which is recorded by a filmmaker who is determined to prove the Claudioistas' beliefs wrong, while making them look as absurd as possible in the process.
 Central to the film's framework is social constructionism, which believes truths to be socially constructed products of culture and history. Claudioismo is an examination of a local myth that dominates the lives of the people of the barangay of Cataggaman, from the point of view of a skeptical and condescending filmmaker-within-the-film. In doing so, the film aims to the idea of question religion, its traditions and organization, as well as its most extreme critics.","MUSICIANS IN FILMS, CULT FILMS",fil,Doc.,27min,"Lim, Khamille","Tan, Hazel; Fabros, Bea; Grande, Phyllis; Gorospe, Rizzi; Lorenzo, Leandro","Lejano, Eduardo",2011,"Manila, Philippines",14.65677,121.0672,UPFI Student Thesis AV Collection,UPFI000379,Image;MovingImage,image/jpeg,2024-01-08 (Created),2011_Claudioismo,Educational use only,https://mainlib.upd.edu.ph/university-archives/revised-policy-on-access-to-theses-and-dissertations-2017/

 Barretto, J.D. (2011). Kuwerdas, Unpublished B.A. Thesis, University of the Philippines College of Mass Communication
 This production thesis explores the story of the reconciliation of a broken relationship between a has-been acoustic singer mother and her college graduating son. The theoretical framework behind this story is based on two theories of communication and interpersonal relationships. First, the Relational Patterns of Interaction of the Palo Alto Group (1954) states that when two people communicate with each other, they define their relationship based on the way they interact. One has to look at the pattern of behavior between partners over time-how they respond to one another. Second, the Relational Schemas in the Family theory of Fitzpatrick and Koerner (2002, 2006) states that there are relational schemas in which families operate on. According to the theory, a schema is an organized set of memories that you make use of whenever you interact with people. Family members have a certain set of memories that they use as basis when interacting with each other.
 
 In this thesis, we see the mother and son as two persons that strive to make a renewed sense of family despite the circumstances they're faced with. New patterns, new schemes, and new memories have to be formed to hopefully bring back what was lost.",MUSICIANS IN FILMS,fil,Nar.,21:37,"Barretto, Chico","Umali, Tin, Puyat, Nikki; Manalaybay, Mico; Cabaclang, Maxinl; Bautista, Cyril; Gomez, Maika","Lejano, Eduardo",2011,"Manila, Philippines",14.65677,121.0672,UPFI Student Thesis AV Collection,UPFI000380,Image;MovingImage,image/jpeg,2024-01-08 (Created),2011_Kuwerdas,Educational use only,https://mainlib.upd.edu.ph/university-archives/revised-policy-on-access-to-theses-and-dissertations-2017/

The two developed a friendship, which is rooted from their yearning of belongingness-the little girl is trying to find her mother, the outcast connects with the child. As they finally understood their situation, the little girl's curiosity leads her to find out about a past she shares with the outcast.
 
 The use of the concept of Aswang in the film is to antagonize prevailing social control mechanisms present in the hostility towards outcasts. The film takes on a horror story not about Aswang or witches, but of the real monsters that social norms have hidden deep into the perception of the community.",RELIGION IN FILMS,fil,Nar.,19:21,"Camelo, Kim Buban","Figuerres, Kim; Malsi, Ilsa; Cabangis, Aaron; Alandy, Joenathan","Alfonso, Grace Javier ",2011,"Manila, Philippines",14.65677,121.0672,UPFI Student Thesis AV Collection,UPFI000382,Image;MovingImage,image/jpeg,2024-01-08 (Created),2011_Sirip,Educational use only,https://mainlib.upd.edu.ph/university-archives/revised-policy-on-access-to-theses-and-dissertations-2017/

In the present capitalist-driven society, the ""real"" world, also known as the corporate world, is where people compete with each other to try to make ends meet. The corporate world becomes the battleground for survival, where reaching the top of the corporate ladder is tantamount to success. Along with that, we, through different forms of media, are fed with images that serve as standards for beauty, sexuality and success. Those who veer away from those standards and ideals are looked down upon. As a result, they isolate themselves and try to find their own niche somewhere else. Majority of these deviant members of society are artists. Non-conformists are propelled to seek escape from what reality offers them. In the film, dreams serve as a venue for escapism, allowing the dreamer, Vincent, to be absorbed with the possibilities unachieved in the waking world. The quest for maximizing one's potential, achieving success, peace of mind and happiness is a common goal shared by every member of society.

 This undergraduate thesis explores the boredom and hypocrisy of the middle- class and how repressive the middle-class lifestyle is. The narrative of the film is framed by Surrealism. Dreams as Wish Fulfillment and Sikolohiyang Pilipino (Filipino Psychology). The idiosyncratic manner in which the Filipino middle-class deals with particular family issues serves as context for the film's story. The middle-class setting plays an important role on the behavior of the characters of the film.","CHRISTMAS IN FILMS, DREAMS IN FILMS",fil,Nar.,39min,"Figuerres, Judd","Figuerres, Edgar; Figuerres, Perla ","Banal, Yason",2011,"Manila, Philippines",14.65677,121.0672,UPFI Student Thesis AV Collection,UPFI000384,Image;MovingImage,image/jpeg,2024-01-08 (Created),2011_BrownoutsaNeighborhoodNaminThatDay,Educational use only,https://mainlib.upd.edu.ph/university-archives/revised-policy-on-access-to-theses-and-dissertations-2017/

 D Osom 2 is a story that revolves around siblings, Masi and Maya. It tells about a young boy, Masi, whose childhood experience drastically changed his simple and hopeful perception of the world. He uses his vivid imagination as his coping mechanism to the longing and worry he feels brought by the uncertainty of where their parents are. Their parents went to a medical mission and cannot be found after. He shares this story to his younger sister Maya to comfort her from the same feeling he has towards their family's circumstance.
 
 Masi creates this superhero story where their parents are the lead superheroes fighting against the ""Bad Mamaws"" in the land which he named ""Kaboomlandia."" He labelled the awesome tandem of their superhero parents as ""D Osom 2.""
 
 The filmmaker believes that it is best for every boys and girls to experience the most out of their childhood. Let them play, laugh, cry, and discover what this world could offer.

 ""Galimgim"" tells the story of a young couple, Gabriel and Agnes, and how their individual choices alter both their lives and relationship with each other.
 
 In the past, Gabriel can be considered as a live-in-the-moment type of person. Though smarter than other boys his age, Gabriel shows no interest in school and tends to dismiss thoughts about serious future matters. He always asks his girlfriend, Agnes, to clope with him. Agnes, on the other hand, is a practical type of person. Working and studying hard in hopes of being able to go off somewhere better and be successful someday, Agnes always rejects Gabriel's proposal to clope. Their lives take a huge turn one night, when Gabriel makes a choice of being part of a hold-up where he accidentally kills someone.
 
 At present, Gabriel is a hitman who has grown more reserved and detached through the years. Nostalgic about his past, Gabriel longs and searches for Agnes, whom he hasn't met with since that night he first killed someone.
 
 The film functions as a way of presenting how choices made by people have effects in their life bigger and irreversible han they can immediately realize. Using flash forwards and flashbacks, this film focuses on choices and memory, showing that past choices and events can only be remembered and not changed. This film also features nostalgia as one of its main themes. With a continuous yearning for the past that can no longer be achieved, people end up settling for second best.",HUMAN RELATIONS IN FILM,fil,Nar.,23:35,"Santiago, Cristina Sandel","Santiago, Hector R; Santiago, Corazon S; Manatad, Carlo Francisco

Fear of her father's reaction as well as the responsibility of becoming a mother motivates her to abort her unborn child. The 38 year old father suspicious of his daughter's actions learns of his daughter's problem. Initially furious and feeling betrayed, he eventually calms down, realizing that his daughter is his only family. Much like his daughter's struggle to talk to him, he faces the problem of reaching out to her.

 This film is about the Secret Santa Society: a group of devoted Christmas enthusiasts from all over the world conspiring with the elves that live in the North Pole. Since Santa Claus has already died, the Secret Santa Society has brought it upon itself to revive and perpetuate the world's belief in Santa Claus. It has been starting gift-giving missions worldwide, following and simulating Santa's method.
 
 In this film, three new accomplices of the society are chosen to be sent on a test mission to the Philippines, which poses challenges on their procedures, on account of it being a different environment.
 
 The film deconstructs a child's role in creating traditions and ways of celebrating for a holiday that has been institutionalized and perpetualized by powers greater and older than him.
 
 This thesis paper questions and challenges the age-old Santa Claus tradition and explores its origins in order to deconstruct the perceived necessity for it and to examine its place in a truly equal relationship between adults and children in our world. It explores the origins of Christmas, its evolving nature and current state represented in media, and the involvement of power in communicating these concepts, and influencing belief, from both the holders of power in media to their audiences, and from adults to children.

 The film tells the story of a cockroach who becomes tired of being mistreated and killed by humans and decides to fight back. He persuades his fellow cockroaches to join his cause by telling them his plans on how to take revenge. However, his firm resolve proves to be insufficient, as an insecticide spray lurking from outside the crack ends his life.
 
 The filmmakers try to use the film as a reflection of society in terms of power struggle and prejudice against minority. In the film, the cockroaches become aware of the oppression that comes from the larger society and they decide to take action and change the system. But despite the awareness that they have, the larger part of the society makes change hard for them to realize. Likewise, marginalized sectors create efforts to free themselves and gain acceptance. However, the majority fails to understand and help them, thus they remain powerless.

  Delos Santos, J.M.T. (2012). Bitiw, Unpublished Student Thesis, University of the Philippines College of Mass Communication.
  Bitiw is about JM, a young physical therapist, who suffered a vehicular accident a year ago wherein he lost his best friend. He is then faced with the revelation that he has been unknowingly treating the hit and run drunk driver who collided with him that night. It is about the exhaustive journey of grief and guilt and how it all leads to a choice. In the end, he begins to show signs of acceptance as he momentarily sets antagonism aside and talks to the only person who can help him understand and eventually recover - his patient.
  The film is psychological in nature and explores internal struggles centered on the dynamics of a car accident. Bitiw borrows tenets of psychoanalytic theory, like defense mechanisms, and Goffman's Frame Analysis while exemplifying the existence of perspective, degree and choice in acceptance and letting go.",HUMAN RELATIONS IN FILM,fil,Nar.,23:50,"Delos Santos, Jenine Marielle","Delos Santos, Jennifer Anne; Delos Santos, Johnny; Delos Santos, Jenine Marielle; Morales, Jerome
