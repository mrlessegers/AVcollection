In the beginning, there was the ""Collective Subconscious"", a video concept in an eight-part series of video shorts (2-5 minutes each) presenting narratives abstracts about life, death, growth, environment, love, sex, religion, and personal values and/or principles. Each with its own set of storyline, characters and filmic distinction that is totally unrelated and disconnected from each other; but generally, unified by one theme that of indifference. or

In its stead came the concept of ""Dreamwalker""; a three-part video production patterned after the ""Collective Subconscious"". Consisting of three video shorts unrelated and disconnected from each other; but generally embraced by the theme of indifference that unifies them. The first two are poems and the third is a narrative non-genre. They are titled: Dreams and Although ""Dreamwalker"" has reached its first rough cut stage, it still has to be dropped, or its first two parts discontinued, and leave the third part to stand alone. To become the final version of the concept that started with eight, and now, that is left to only one. In the beginning, there were eight, and in the end, there was only One.

With the aim of contributing in the dissemination of knowledge concerning the damage being done to our surroundings, Ms. Cabusao and Ms. Macasaet chose to make an environmental thesis production. production Wanting to produce an environmental different from the usual pollution and illegal loggings, the two thought of doing one on coral reefs. And after deliberating over the best possible way of realizing said project, Ms. Cabusao and Ms. Macasaet finally decided that they could better visualize the coral reefs by using the technique of animation.
The two were joined by two other students, Ms. Sherida Castilla and Ms. Elaine Lazarito, who were having difficulties with their own topic proposal. So much so that Ms. Cabusao and Ms. Macasaet offered the two to join the group in making the animation. Thank God Ms. Castilla and Ms. Lazarito agreed to make the group a foursome.
Nightmares (Are Made Of...), Anyone Lived in A Pretty How Tawn (by E.E.Cummings), and One, respectively.
But Dreamwalker has to be dropped.
Both concepts (Collective Subconscious and Dreamwalker) aim to produce visually, or in video, certain feelings emotions, moods, characteristics, attitudes, more with the unconventional use and and manipulation of the camera, the lights, and the editing equipments; and less with the characters and the script itself.
Moreso, both concepts aim to make use of collected, unrelated footages, distorted shots, and flat frames; and then montaging them to create a simple (even basic), yet unconventional approach to the expression of everyday and often taken-for-granted sentiments of people. a
Both are a great challenge for a filmmaker, and both are exciting filmically as student much as literarily. But both are difficult (even complex) for a student with very limited resources. The magnanimity of the work to be done (in all the aspects of production), the financing to be made, the casting to be arranged; coupled with the wideness of scope of the shooting and all the camera work that has to be achieved could all have been a drain of time, money, and effort for a lone student filmmaker. Reason enough to cut concepts to their utmost limits.

""Dreams Deferred"" is a video documentary about gifted children in the Philippines. Traditionally, the ""special"" children who have been given attention in this country have been the ones on the other extreme of the spectrum: the handicapped, or mentally/physically challenged. Special children who are exceptionally intelligent or talented-- gifted-- have been assumed to be able to take care of themselves. After all, they are gifted. In a country short on resources, they have no choice but to fend for themselves.
This mistaken notion has resulted in a great loss of opportunity for the Philippines. One can only imagine what they might have been able to achieve for the development of the nation had their gifts been properly nurtured. This documentary is an attempt to focus attention on this often ignored and little explored subject.
Recently, the media particularly broadcast and print media have trained the spotlight on the gifted. In the past months and years articles have been written and segments have been done in mainstream newspapers and television shows. Gifted children even became the theme of a national advertising campaign for a product (Promil) by a major company (Wyeth-Suaco). All these efforts have done much to place the education of the gifted in the national consciousness.
This thesis is an attempt to contribute to that effort. Its title takes its inspiration from a poem by Langston Hughes, written from the point of view of a black child in America wondering if his dreams will ever be fulfilled given the enormous obstacles he faces as a marginalized member of his society. Through the use of well-organized and creative visuals, the documentary explores the challenge posed to gifted children in a country which can offer so little in terms of resources, infrastructure, and other kinds of support. This filmmaker's hope is that it will educate its viewers about the issues and questions involved in the subject of gifted children. Though seemingly not as urgent as other national issues, the author believes that it is a significant one which deserves priority. Its target audience is everyone-- students of all fields, parents, professionals, educators who, collectively and in their own ways, could have an impact on the way gifted chidren are viewed and treated in the Philippines.

ISANG SILIP is a video narrative that combines soft-core science fiction with contemporary crime drams. It is a hypothetical fast forward to a time when all the ""What ifs"" could come true. The narrative paints a cold and harsh look into the future of Philippine society where someday, violence may be condoned and accepted as a means to claim justice.
Despite the stark and cynical backdrop, ISANG SILIP presents a touch of humanity in its story line, a spark of hope in the form of one's quest for freedom and redemption. The filmmakers have set out to prioritize this element by stressing the dramatic flow, in order to create a certain ""human side"" to the narrative and at the same time make the film uniquely different from other science fiction movies. As a result, the narrative has an amalgam of different genres. The danger in a virtually lawless society, the lonely search for a new beginning and the future's satirical bite make ISANG SILIP truly exceptional in itself.
Throughout time, humanity has valued freedom highly. The film reflects this quality in the persona of the lead character, whose motive is to seek liberation. The narrative as a whole conveys human angst, a feeling of loneliness and desolation, revenge and redemption, hate and desire.
The film will embody what media has inadvertently portrayed--a world of consuming violence. People have been left with little or no control over what is being fed to them. This narrative is an answer to those who present brutality onscreen. ISANG SILIP gives a dose of the reality that people are being influenced by this violence, somehow.

What this research aims to uncover is nothing especially new in the sense that this has been topics of discussions ever since. It aims to point out how we have been greatly influenced by the Spaniards further, even after colonizing us, imprinting upon us their culture. This great transformation, despite its presence today, is mixed with other strong influences. The question now is this: what is truly Filipino? We have been led to believe that the conservative attitude is what is truly Filipino while the liberal attitude is what is modern and foreign. But actually, as proven by the book Pagsusulatan nang Dalauang Binibini na si Urbana at ni Feliza na Nagtuturo ng Mabuting Kaugalian by Padre Modesto de Castro in 1864, we have been influenced into a culture, arguably was dictatted by the book. Thus the Filipino concept of 'perfect housewives, ""lady-like', and 'walang-modo', and so on, have been based on a constructed culture written by a Spanish priest. So the question again stands: What is truly Filipino?
After having read Ambeth Ocampo's books, Rizal Without the Overcoat and Looking Back, the researcher/filmmaker has realized that there are so much more interesting facts about our culture and our history than what was learned in school and at home. This interest was furthered by the book Pagsusulatan nang Dalauang Binibini na si Urbana at ni Feliza na Nagtuturo ng Mabuting Kaugalian written by Padre Modesto de Castro in 1864. This book was found to be particularly interesting not only because it was trying to dictate social norms (which today, in comparison, would be far-fetched), but also because it was in this period that the social norms today began.
This thesis intends to re-present and reflect upon the kind of culture that we have today; tracing its roots to the 19th century, the age of Maria Clara and religious fanaticism. This historical flashback aims to help the audience to understand the origins of this culture.

The thesis of the documentary is that a lesbian can assimilate herself in society given the love and support her nuclear family.
In Philippine society, the individual does not exist independently from his family. The family live in such a way that its members learn to care and take responsibility of each other. And as the case may be, the individual values acceptance within the family more than he values acceptance within society.
The researchers of this study believe that when a family member is ostracized by society for being homosexual, the family, especially the younger siblings, bears the brunt of social castigation. This pernicious attitude towards the homosexual compels the family to defend the individual.

When ""Paalam"" was still being written, the writers' main purpose was to pay a final tribute to their loved ones who had just passed away. It will be their last gift. their final good-bye and thank you to the special and treasured memories of beloved parents and a cherished grandfather. However, when the script entered its final draft, the writers' discovered other dimensions to the film's objectives.
The narrative is dedicated to the writers' relatives who have moved on but it is also for those who are left behind. ""Paalam"" aims to help enlighten the minds of the people who underwent similar experiences, that grief. no matter how painful, can never be quantified. Also, the film's other goal is to help guide the friends of the mourners as to how they should relate with them. Death is painful, it is tragic and traumatic but after watching ""Paalam"" it is the writers hope that viewers will see death not as an absolute despair but rather hopeful.

In a 1986 study by Theresa C. Carino entitled, Chinese Women in Manila: Changing Roles and Perceptions, she compared two generations of Philippine Chinese women, 20 college girls and their mothers. She was surprised to find that while the daughters had higher career aspirations than their mothers, both generations still believed home management to be an exclusively female domain. Also, while these women described men in general as ""intelligent, had leadership attributes, were agressive, logical, self-confident, ambitious, competitive and competent,"" they described themselves with adjectives commonly associated with the subordinate sex: 1 ""intelligent, sensitive, faithful, honest, emotional, religious, submissive, and gentle."" Obviously, a difference in ages or generation does not necessarily mean a difference in views. Is it the culture then, that makes these women think this way? And of course, there are those little, big signs that everyone sees everywhere. That ad in the paper, making one believe: Woman! Skinnier is better. That cutesy actress in that cutesy film with her wondah-ful clothes and mah-velous hats. What woman can resist the urge to splurge after that? And that song. Are girls just Barbie girls, to be undressed anywhere? There must be a conspiracy in media to make women feel bad about themselves. Is it any wonder that it is so hard for a woman to gain self-worth?
HerStory traces the history of Joan, a 23-year old woman of Chinese descent. It is Joan's story of how she lost and found herself. But man is never the enemy.

Life and love between two brothers living the pressures of growing up in the 90's. The two brothers are very close when growing up but their differences and age gap causes their separation. The love tries to be maintained but their love for one another fades away with time due to the problems of life (parental & peer pressure & substance abuse). The story also tackles the theme of irony and how these pressures can affect this brotherly love that can result into tragedy.

""Manyika is a three-minute experimental film about a woman's worth in a conservative society's eyes. It is a commentary on how a woman is expected to be nothing more than a doll, willing to be manipulated by the demands to conform to the standards of the social structure she is born and confined into.
Our film is a study of contrasts between the only two options a Filipina is damned into. She can either be the angel- the innocent, pure epitome of the mores; or the slut- a dirty woman, unworthy of anyone's respect. This, in a world where there are few, if rare, exceptions. Society is quick to judge, preferring the vulnerable, innocent angel that it can freely manipulate to the unwed, non-virgins. In our opinion, both personas are less than ideal and are both limiting to a woman's potential. A woman's worth therefore, is so mistakenly judged by the existence of that fragile sheath of skin between her legs and not by her strengths, talents or capabilities. Her chastity or lack thereof has nothing to do with who she is, but sadly it has everything to do with what society sees her to be. It doesn't have to be one or the other. There are gradations of color between white and red, and it is time people started to see and appreciate the variety of color that lies between them.",PROSTITUTES IN FILM,fil,Expe. ,4:02,"Padilla, Karen Marie P.; Tenorio, Maria Lourdes S.","Padilla, Ramoncito; Padilla, Mary Ann; Tenorio, Antonio; Tenorio, Lirio; Lee, Ruben; Padilla, Karen; Cruz, Glenn; Factora, Mylene; Macas, Audrey;","De Guzman, Anne Marie G.

With the help of her friends, Jane tries to lose weight within one week. During the span of one week, she experiences the difficulty that comes with being overweight and the pressure that society puts on being thin and beautiful. In the end, she realizes that the only ways to feel good and have fun is to accept herself as she is. The reason why I chose this topic for my thesis is because the issue of being overweight in a thin society has been confronting me all my life. I have tried everything to lose weight but nothing worked. The so-called problem is in my genes but society doesn't want to accept that. They would rather think of fat people as being lazy slobs who eat all day. I am sick of trying to measure up to society's standards of beauty.

Ang aking tesis na isang maikling naratibong pinamagatang ""Paglisan"" ay tungkol sa mga ala-ala ng isang ina sa kanyang kaisa-isang anak na babae na humiwalay na sa kanya. Isang pagsilip sa buhay ni Nicole (ang ina) sa pamamagitan ng pagbukas ng isang pahina sa kanyang buhay talaan - ang kanyang pinakatatagong diary. Sa pagdaloy ng pelikula ay malalaman nating noong ipinagbubuntis pa lamang ni Nicole ang kanyang anak ay gusto na itong ipalaglag o patayin ni Miguel, ang kanyang asawa. Ngunit hindi siya napilit nito at itinuloy pa rin niya ang pagbubuntis hanggang sa maipanganak nga niya si Denerisa.
Mula pagkabata ni Denerisa ay hindi na siya pinakitaan ng pagmamahal ng ama niya. Nariyang sinasaktan siya ng pisikal maliban sa emosyonal na pagpapasakit nito sa anak sa pagtanda. At bilang isang ina ay ang tanging maipapalit niya sa mga sakit na ito ay ang kanyang pagaaruga, paguunawa at pasensya.
Hanggang sa makapagtapos na ang kanyang anak. Sa araw ng pagkamit ng diploma ng anak, naaalala niya ang mga pangyayaring nagsilbing sanhi ng mga sakit at galit na rin mula sa anak para sa ama. At sa pagalis ng kanyang anak ay hinahangad niya ang isang buhay na punong-puno ng ganap na pagmamahal, isang buhay na kailanman ay hindi natagpuan ng anak sa sariling pamilya.
Ang katapusan ng pelikula ay hindi masaya at hindi rin malungkot. Ito ay puro tinatapos sa mga salitang hangad ay pagasa para sa anak at para na rin sa ama.","MEMORY IN FILMS

The documentary follows the search of two film students as they look for their old toys and old memories. In the process they interview fellow children of the 1980's and discover that they are not alone in their search, it seems that others are remembering and feel the need to bring their old toys back as well. This leads them to interview certain people who could help explain their fascination with bringing back these old toys. Ultimately they come up with a conclusion that will change the way they look at toys forever.
The documentary is a mixture of styles drawn from both the classic documentaries and modern documentaries. In some scenes the film extensively uses visual graphics while in others it tries to capture the ""moment"" as it actually happens such as the unrehearsed verity of them as they search for their old toys in a toy warehouse.
The search of the two film makers does not only bring nostalgia or memories back to the children of the 1980's, but it also gives a timely assessment and analysis which brings a new perspective into how we should a look at significant objects from our past.",CARTOON CHARACTERS IN FILMS,fil,Doc.,0:29:24,"Baizas, Ricky; Cayetano, Lino ","Baizas, Melecio; Baizas, Violeta; Cayetano, Renato; Cayetano, Sandra; Baizas, Ricky; Cayetano, Lino; Martinez, Boy; ","Velasco, Jovenal D.

Ang pamilya ay itinuturing na pundasyon ng ating lipunan. Ito ang pinakapangunahing elemento o bahagi ng isang bubong na kung tawagin ay lipunan. Sa kanya kumita ng liwanag ang mga kaisipang nagpabago, nagpapabago, at magpapabago sa ating kapaligiran. Salamin din ito ng namamayaning kultura at mahahalagang pangyayari sa ating mga buhay. Ito ang tanggulan ng isang kaluluwang naligaw ng landas o ng isang tinig na nagkamit ng tagumpay. Bawat kasapi ay may isang mahalagang bahaging ginagampanan. Ang ama ang haligi, ang ina ang ilaw, at ang anak ang mga anghel na nakasilong sa mapagpalang mga kamay ng mga magulang Bawat kasapi ay kabilang sa milyon-milyong indibidwal na may sariling mundong ginagalawan na kapag nagsama-sama ay maaaring pagmulan ng isang maganda o hindi magandang kahihinatnan

Pangunahing layunin ng pelikulang ito ang maipahiwatig ang saloobin ng pagtutol sa pagiging patriarkal ng ating lipunan. Nais nitong maipakita ang paghiling ng pagkakapantay-pantay ng lalake at babae bakla o tomboy. Ang pagtutol sa ideolohiyang patriarkal ay matagal nang nagsimula, ngunit hanggang ngayon ay hindi pa rin lubusang nakakamit ang kanilang layunin. Ang pelikula ay nagtatangka na kahit papaano ay makatulong sa patuloy na pakikipaglaban ng mga kababaihan at mga bakla sa ating lipunan.
